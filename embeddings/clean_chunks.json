Vision Statement St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School is a diverse community dedicated to developing the whole child. We nurture spiritual growth, an appreciation for life-long learning, the courage to lead and a responsibility to give to others. Our graduates are independent thinkers of integrity and compassion who reveal their resilience and collaborative nature in the face of challenge and opportunity. Core Values List of 5 items. Character We emphasize integrity, spirituality, empathy, perseverance and responsibility. Community We champion mutual respect, engagement, collaboration, service learning and a commitment to the common good. Balance and Breadth We believe personal growth, balance and well-being are fostered through a broad range of academic, artistic, athletic and co-curricular opportunities. Equity and Inclusion We embrace and celebrate the identity of every human being, and advocate for equity, inclusion and justice. High Expectations We prepare and empower our students to discover and develop their unique gifts and talents to achieve their full potential. St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs. Episcopal Identity St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School is upheld by the basic principles of our Episcopal tenets that individuals and institutions are called to strive for justice and peace among all people, and to respect the dignity of every human being. Episcopal schools are not solely communities for Christians, rather as ecumenical and diverse ministries of educational and human formation for people of all faiths and backgrounds. Episcopal schools also integrate religious and spiritual formation into the curriculum and life of the school community. Episcopal schools exist not merely to educate, but to demonstrate and proclaim the unique worth and beauty of all human beings. As an Episcopal School we uphold our Statement of Faith in carrying out the important work of our mission. Our tradition appreciates the mystery and breadth of God\u2019s love and inspires debate, welcomes diverse ideas, values ambiguity and paradox, and respects traditions other than those set out in the Book of Common Prayer, the basis for corporate worship in the Episcopal Church. We affirm the right of each child and each member of our community to follow spiritual paths free from coercion\u2014paths open to discussion and inquiry that are respectful of the Episcopal tradition and of differing views. From Early Childhood School through Upper School, opportunities for spiritual learning, worship, prayer, reflection, and participation in the Eucharist are offered and comprise a foundation for all students to recognize the importance of their own spirituality and the critical value of acceptance and understanding among people of different faiths. The vision of our founding headmaster, The Reverend Canon Ernest D. Sillers, continues to guide us today, \u201cEvery student is a sacred and precious child of God, endowed with the potential to become a productive, contributing member of society. Our purpose is to prepare students for life in a complex society, beset with grave problems and great pressures, by providing a strong program in character development and teaching morals undergirded with basic Judeo-Christian values.\u201d We seek to prepare future leaders of conviction and perspective who can appreciate the powerful, positive role that inclusivity and understanding can have on the future direction of human kind. We expect our students to strive for justice and peace among all peoples, and respect the dignity of every human being.* As a result, we expect our students to be contributing members of our school community and the world beyond. From the Baptismal Covenant of the Book of Common Prayer* We are fortunate to be identified as an Episcopal school, not only because this expresses the importance and centrality of God\u2019s grace, love and power in the raising of children, but also because this tradition provides a compass for our navigation through the shifting winds of change so prevalent in our lives today. We strive to act out of love, to teach love, to model love and to love one another in this community. As an Episcopal School, we will always consider God in reviewing our mission and maintaining our course. 26 We realize that some of our graduates may encounter times of uncertainty of their faith and lacking absolute clarity in their lives. In these instances, have we failed them? Our answer is no. We believe that the grounding they acquire here in study, reflection, debate and conscious pursuit of spirituality will serve as an enduring guide and offer consolation in times of doubt and confusion. Our job is to plant seeds that, with God\u2019s help, will flourish in time. To read about our student Chapel program, please click here .

Our mission, core values, and DEI work are rooted in our Episcopal identity, which calls us to seek God in and honor the dignity of every human being. Our Equity and Inclusion core value compels us: We embrace and celebrate the identity of every human being, and advocate for equity, inclusion, and justice. We aim to create an environment at St. Margaret\u2019s where every Tartan is known and loved for who they are and who they are fully. Fostering that environment requires continued strategic planning, captured through our innovation strategy, accreditation focus areas, and yearly DEI priorities. List of 3 items. What do we mean by Diversity? We recognize and celebrate that diversity exists in the backgrounds and experiences that have shaped our lives. Diversity encompasses the complexity of the human experience: our life experiences, our journeys through the world, the faiths we observe, the traditions we practice, the structures of our families, our socioeconomic statuses, the languages we speak, the colors of our skin, our abilities, our physical, social, emotional, and spiritual needs, and the list goes on. These myriad intersecting identities shape us as individuals, in groups, and in our school community. At St. Margaret\u2019s, we are proud that our Tartans\u2019 many backgrounds, life experiences, and identities weave together to form a wonderful fabric that unites us and prepares our students for living in a complex global society. What do we mean by Inclusion? By inclusion, we mean our ability to honor and respect the dignity of every human being. Inclusion means that when Tartans walk onto campus, they can bring their full selves each and every day. Each of our backgrounds, perspectives, and social identifiers belong here\u2014fully and without exception. I am my full self. I belong. When we engage in inclusion work, we ask ourselves, \u201cIs every member of our community able to co-create the culture of our school? Whose voices and experiences are included? Whose are not?\u201d \u201cBeing seen, valued and loved for who you are by nurturing adults and peers is the rich soil in which a young person flourishes and thrives. We have a wonderfully diverse community of people who come from many cultures, backgrounds and experiences. We want every Tartan to feel they belong here. At its most fundamental level, DEI work is love work. It is about ensuring that every member of our community is known and experiences a sense of belonging,\u201d says Director of Equity and Inclusion Victor Cota. What do we mean by Equity? Whenever and wherever we find that certain voices and experiences are less represented than others, that is when our equity work kicks in. We understand that ours is a world of imbalanced access to opportunities and resources. As a result, people in the same community will have very different experiences. When we engage in equity work, we ask ourselves, \u201cWho is favored? Who is not? Who has privilege in this situation? Who does not?\u201d Then, as we become more comfortable and informed, we ask, \u201cWhat will we do about it?\u201d Sometimes this means reflecting on individual behaviors and sometimes it means examining entire systems. What matters is that we recognize that inequity exists, work to identify it, and ask the questions to fully understand it, move through any subsequent discomfort, and act. At St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School, we are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. List of 1 members.

College is an essential next step for almost all of our graduates, though our mission is focused more broadly on nurturing children to develop, succeed and thrive in life, today and tomorrow. Rooted in a strong foundation of educational expertise, research, leading pedagogy and best practice, St. Margaret\u2019s vigorous liberal arts academic program is the core roadmap of our students\u2019 growth and maturation to adulthood. It is developmentally appropriate and coordinated from early childhood to high school graduation. The breadth and depth of the academic program provides student choice and relevance that cultivate personal meaning and voice. Opportunities for exploration, discovery, service and leadership abound in STEAM, experiential and interdisciplinary learning, arts and athletics engage and nurture every child at every age in their unique talents. The program is vigorous, inspiring students to set high aspirations, work at the highest levels and achieve their full potential. We are proud of the exceptional quality and expertise of our educators, whom we attract from across the nation. Our professional community is committed to excellence in education and continue to hone their craft as professionals. A passion for student learning and growth motivates our educators, and they are deeply invested in their students' growth and well-being. St. Margaret\u2019s expert faculty members foster authentic engagement and enduring understandings based on inquiry, critical thinking, in-depth analysis, creative thinking and problem solving. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of measurement with a focus on mastery learning, yet we recognize that not all students learn at the same pace and in the same way. Our experienced educators use formative and summative data to inform their teaching practices in the classroom to support every student. A hallmark of a St. Margaret\u2019s education is the many faculty members who are engaged and involved in the life of each student. Students are supported by a professional community of teachers, advisors, college counselors, chaplains and coaches. Our class sizes are small so every teacher knows and loves every student and differentiates instruction accordingly. Further, the mission of educating hearts and minds requires St. Margaret\u2019s to understand the motivational and affective components of passion, interest, relevance and meaning in the learning process. Through an appreciation of diversity, the interconnectedness of the human experience, and real global and environmental challenges, students experience learning in a dynamic, resource-rich environment where problems are complex and answers are ambiguous and they are nurtured and empowered to make claims and find solutions. We are developing learners of the future, with the capacity to lead, the humility to serve, the passion to pursue interests, the strength to overcome challenges, and the will to make the world a better place.

As a subject area specialist, the chair leads the department in curricular reviews to vertically and horizontally align curriculum in grades 4 through 12. Department chairs are responsible for developing new courses and staying on the leading edge of content and pedagogy within the discipline. As lead teachers, department chairs guide department faculty in department goals, planning, and discussions, and provide professional development opportunities that reflect promising practices in instruction within each discipline.

Computer Science The St. Margaret\u2019s community is empowered by emerging technologies without boundaries, transcending traditional approaches to teaching and learning. Using the design thinking model, we promote experiential, collaborative and creative learning in order to demystify the complexities often associated with technology. Students develop a greater capacity for computational thinking, problem solving, and expanding their competencies to synthesize and communicate ideas, which empowers them to explore and create. In addition, students engage in research and scholarship which will be applied to lifelong pursuits and participation in the global community. The Computer Science Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Select appropriate technologies and critically examine sources. Engage in research and problem-solving, utilizing technologies applicable to each curricular area. Learn in a collaborative community that is connected to the world at large. Become confident in using technologies as a lifelong tool to enhance learning processes. Apply computational thinking strategies for analyzing and developing solutions to problems.

English The English Department seeks to develop in each student the ability to write clear and persuasive prose, the skills required to read and interpret literature, and the power to make full use of written and spoken language. We are consistent in our use of the process approach to writing. We help students put their written work through a thoughtful and often time-consuming process of drafting and revision. Through repeated emphasis on critical thinking and writing, students encounter both themselves and differing voices in small group environments that encourage discussion. Through the study of literature, students experience diversity in voice and develop empathy for the alternative narratives of the human experience. In the end, the study of literature invites the ongoing questions: who am I in the world, and what does it mean to be human? The English Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Master the processes of reading, writing, and speaking Analyze texts, interpret, and read for subtexts, hidden meanings, and paradoxes Develop the art of communication and personal expression Read actively and connect to previous knowledge and experience Understand one\u2019s own process of learning Empathize with the stories of others and alternative narratives of human expression Discover and develop insight and personal identity through literature Think critically History & Social Science The History Department believes that knowledge of the past is necessary to comprehend the present and to forge the future thoughtfully and deliberately. We foster the sheer enjoyment of the adventure of historical discovery and study, seeing ourselves in the present as interconnected with people of the past \u2013 our families, fellow citizens and humanity around the globe. Through the study of history, students will learn foundational content, think carefully and precisely, interpret bias, and articulate thinking in oral and written form. Research of primary documents will foster critical readers who are able to analyze and synthesize data in order to develop and prove a thesis. Small discussion groups and writing workshops help our students to develop an awareness of oneself with the ability to respect, understand, and appreciate differences. In our work as historians, we develop the requisite skills to embrace purposefully life\u2019s journey and challenges as we learn to understand ourselves and humanity.

While we value the mastery of skills and computational techniques, we stress the understanding of concepts and the significance of results. Our instructors create a supportive learning community that encourages collaboration both in and out of the classroom.

Through experiences in Dance, Music, and Theater, students discover and nurture the artist within. As students are introduced to the fundamentals of an art form, they learn how to learn. As their skill increases through practice, they become comfortable viewing their own work - as well as the work of others - as a journey, not a destination. We believe that the power of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As members of ensembles, students celebrate their own work and the work of their peers. The transforming power of the Arts is vividly experienced as students become conduits, connecting their humanity to generations of artists and audiences. The Performing Arts Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Learn and apply fundamentals skills and techniques such as the reading of music.

The curriculum is designed to provide students with the skills necessary to build a foundation of comprehensive wellness by learning to create and analyze individualized plans. The classes incorporate personal goal setting, exercise physiology, strength training, cardiovascular training, mindfulness, yoga, and interdependent thinking to promote lifelong patterns of healthy behavior.

We seek to live examined lives and explore faith by asking questions, encouraging spirited debate, and instilling a sense of wonder. Through religion classes we develop a deeper understanding of the basic tenants of Christian faith and how course material can help us in everyday life. Exploration of other world religions and philosophies encourages students to understand similarities and differences and the role that faith and religion plays in other countries and cultures. Science The Science Department believes that science is a process rooted in curiosity, awe, understanding and respect for the natural world in which we live. Students are encouraged to become autonomous learners in a collaborative environment. We teach students to be critical thinkers who use logic, experimental design, and problem solving as vehicles for discovery. Through a carefully constructed curriculum, our students develop scientific literacy, understand the research process, and hone effective communication skills. We apply the scientific method throughout a student\u2019s experience at St. Margaret\u2019s and empower budding scientists to formulate interesting questions, develop a hypothesis, design an experiment, analyze results, and report a thoughtful conclusion. Our students learn to think logically and critically and to transfer scientific knowledge and skills to other disciplines.

At the core of the St. Margaret\u2019s art experience is developing ones personal passions. In a studio art environment students learn an array of mental habits such as visual-spatial abilities, reflection, self-criticism, and the willingness to experiment and learn from mistakes.

Students come to the Library and Learning Commons to access information, literature and technology support. Beyond the collection of books, it provides a gateway to a vast catalog of credible web-based resources.

Adjacent to the Learning Commons is a computer science and robotics lab, weaving together immersive technologies and innovation in a space designed to enhance collaboration and experiential learning. This state-of-the-art classroom provides a place where students and faculty from across multiple disciplines can discover and learn. In addition, a separate part of the Library is dedicated to Early School and Lower School students.

As part of their Upper School experience, St. Margaret\u2019s students take part in a comprehensive college-counseling curriculum that guides students and their families toward finding college environments that best fit each student\u2019s individual journey. Students develop relationships with St. Margaret\u2019s College Counseling Office and their designated college counselor early in their Upper School years through informational meetings, consultations about academic planning and other touchpoints. The curriculum expands during a student\u2019s junior year, as the College Counseling Office helps students and their families explore post-secondary options and introduce programming during the school day to provide education and guidance on topics such as college applications, essay writing and financial aid. By the beginning of their senior year, students and their families will continue to work close with St. Margaret\u2019s college counselors to develop lists, review applications and essays and develop an understanding of deadlines and other dynamics as they begin applying to colleges and universities. The college-application process is an essential part of a St. Margaret\u2019s education, and we celebrate the success and decisions of all of our students. Through the college-application process, we hope students develop introspection, empathy, ownership, resilience and joy as they decide on the next step of their educational journey with confidence and excitement.

We are a school with a clear mission to educate the hearts and minds of young people for lives of learning, leadership and service. We are committed to knowing and loving each of our students as we guide them to discover passions, explore new pathways, establish healthy habits, and develop relationships that will nurture them throughout their Upper School experience and beyond. We are proud of our reputation as a school that combines a supportive, dynamic environment with high expectations, and we celebrate our students\u2019 extraordinary growth and accomplishments. Students arrive to the Upper School in the early years of adolescence, on the heels of grade 8, and leave as college freshmen, well prepared for the next step in their educational journey. During this transformation, we provide rich opportunities for the development of values, passions, and skills that lead to meaningful and successful lives. Curiosity, work ethic, resilience, empathy, creativity and kindness are skills and character traits we endeavor to grow and develop in these important formative years, because who our students are as people is as important as their academic success. The intimate size of the Upper School and faculty-student ratio allows for authentic and meaningful relationships to flourish between students and teachers. We offer a vigorous, relevant and innovative curriculum taught by expert faculty, of whom nearly 90 percent hold an advanced degree in their field. We offer a full range of honors and Advanced Placement courses to challenge and stretch our students in areas that are of interest to them, from humanities to STEAM courses. Courses such as software engineering, macroeconomics, multivariable calculus, wealth, poverty and ethics, and post AP Spanish allow students to individualize their program and pursue depth in areas of interest. Co-curricular opportunities are central to the St. Margaret\u2019s experience. We offer 24 varsity sports including football, cross country, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, volleyball, baseball and equestrian. Multiple athletics fields and gymnasiums serve as welcome host to many Tartan sports competitions that draw parents, guests and much of the student body together\u2014led by a highly-spirited student cheering section, fondly named \u201cThe Kitchen,\u201d outfitted with an assortment of food-related costumes. Our arts faculty supports a broad and exceptional arts programs in theater, concert band, orchestra, choir, dance and visual arts. Each year our young artists demonstrate unbridled creativity, dedication, and excellence through productions, concerts, exhibits and competitions, which are shared with our entire community. The opportunity to study and perform in the 45,000-square-foot Performing Arts Center supports our award-winning program. A glimpse into our everyday experience might include students and faculty sharing lunch in the Tartan Courtyard, a collaborative leadership meeting such as Peer Counselors, ASB or our Tartan Inclusivity and Diversity Education group where students and faculty meet to develop and execute programs that support our community. That same day, students may meet as an entire Upper School community for Convocation, also known as \u201cConvo,\u201d to hear students and faculty share important information, inspire others through a personal story and celebrate each other\u2019s accomplishments. They may also meet in an Advisory group which consists of 10 peers and a trusted faculty member who remain together throughout the four years of Upper School. In this space, they may discuss topics relevant to school and life beyond school or they may play a game and share a snack together. Our focus on service learning is ingrained in our school community, and endeavors to create meaningful relationships, contributions and lasting impact. Students work in advisory groups on special days built into the schedule to partner with local non-profit organizations that they choose, and build an ongoing relationship to support and serve their unique organizational needs. Students complete their service requirement during the school day. There is much to share about the St. Margaret\u2019s Upper School and we look forward to conversations with you about how our \u201ceveryday\u201d Tartan experience might be a right fit for you and your family. We are guided by our Honor Statement that elevates our community where our best is expected, nurtured and celebrated every day. Our community is distinguished by visible and compelling mutual respect, joy and vitality. Amy Roberts Principal, Upper School Upper School Honor Statement Conducting oneself honorably is essential to living a meaningful and successful life.

They can change the emphasis of the course of study to the serious interests that the seniors are developing and the eventual work that they might be able to do. . . [in] a serious senior project that would require practice in the qualities the seniors need to take to their next work, such as emotional stamina, making well-informed choices of what to study and create, managing time well and adjusting to change. Internships may often be an excellent adjunct to these projects, since they emphasize the learning that can come from experience and from colleagues.\" In the final weeks of the seniors' careers at St. Margaret's Episcopal School, students participate in Independent Senior Projects (ISPs). The main goal of the ISP program is to create a transition for the seniors from the structure of high school to the independence of college. We hope to give students a chance to apply their in-school learning to real world experiences outside the classroom, and to realize what life is like outside of a school setting. ISPs are a golden opportunity for students and the institution as a whole to demonstrate the effectiveness of the school's mission and core values. One of the hallmarks of a St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School education is a connection to the real world. Here, education is not pursued in a vacuum, as we strive to equip students with the habits of mind and the skills and knowledge to thrive. This self-designed educational experience pushes students to: Transition to an independent environment Apply classroom learning to real-life situations Constructively use time during and after AP exams worthy of ceasing instruction in other classes Allows all divisions to see the outcome of the high school experience essentially giving them a direction to aspire to. St. Margaret\u2019s wishes to strengthen the \u201cbridge\u201d between our school and the surrounding community. By reaching out to different groups in our community (parents, alumni, and local businesses) we will secure meaningful projects for our seniors. The Four Types of Independent Senior Projects: List of 4 items. 1. Internship or Apprenticeship Includes working with a business, artistic, educational or government organization to learn about a given field or career. 2. Service Learning Projects Allow students to expand their involvement with community service organizations and invest time and energy that is not ordinarily possible during the academic year. 3. Academic Inquiry May be interpreted broadly to include visual and performing arts, but also other creative endeavors such as independent research, writing, culinary arts, religious exploration \u2013 the possibilities are endless. 4. Job Allow students to acquire a job in their local area where they can work a minimum of 18 hours per week during the designated independent project period.

As part of their Upper School experience, St. Margaret\u2019s students take part in a comprehensive college-counseling curriculum that guides students and their families toward finding college environments that best fit each student\u2019s individual journey. Students develop relationships with St. Margaret\u2019s College Counseling Office and their designated college counselor early in their Upper School years through informational meetings, consultations about academic planning and other touchpoints. The curriculum expands during a student\u2019s junior year, as the College Counseling Office helps students and their families explore post-secondary options and introduce programming during the school day to provide education and guidance on topics such as college applications, essay writing and financial aid. By the beginning of their senior year, students and their families will continue to work close with St. Margaret\u2019s college counselors to develop lists, review applications and essays and develop an understanding of deadlines and other dynamics as they begin applying to colleges and universities. The college-application process is an essential part of a St. Margaret\u2019s education, and we celebrate the success and decisions of all of our students. Through the college-application process, we hope students develop introspection, empathy, ownership, resilience and joy as they decide on the next step of their educational journey with confidence and excitement.

(Bring Your Own Device) technology philosophy to help create that landscape where learning is available for all students. Clearly, when students are already comfortable with their device, frustration is limited and time and energy can be directed toward learning. Our students may choose an iPad, a tablet from another provider, a Surface, or a full laptop based on their needs and preferences. Factors like \u201cconsuming\u201d versus \u201cproducing\u201d, number crunching capability, ease of mobility, cost, screen definition all play a role in student choice. We do expect each student to have a device, with greater functionality than a phone, with them at school each day. Most standard devices will be capable of scheduling, note taking, accessing online resources and managing any specific tools the faculty feel would aid the student. One observation that may be helpful is that many students move to a more powerful machine as they move through Upper School and they find their \u201cconsumer\u201d/ \u201cproducer\u201d needs change. Finally, we appreciate and fully leverage the importance and ubiquitous nature of technology in the fast and mobile world our students will graduate into. However, education is a uniquely human enterprise and we honor that by also deeply valuing relationship and putting inspiring faculty in front of your children each and every day.

Our Middle School program is designed to provide opportunities for students to engage in activities that support their growth as learners, leaders and compassionate members of the community who see the beauty and worth of all human beings. These three years are times of incredible growth for our students. Being surrounded by a community that cares for each other will build a sense of belonging and self-worth which will help them to think with their minds and their hearts throughout their lives. At St. Margaret\u2019s, we believe early adolescents should be exposed to a rich and vibrant program that enables them to explore challenges in diverse arenas. Our students thrive through their participation in academic , athletic , artistic and leadership programs . Small class sizes ensure that students are known and seen, which provides a safe and nurturing environment to have high academic expectations where taking intellectual risks are encouraged. Our enrichment program ensures all students are exposed to the full breadth of a liberal arts education and have the opportunity to pursue interests beyond the core curriculum. Watching our students grow through Upper School and successfully thrive in college and beyond provides us with continual feedback that our Middle School prepares students for the academic challenges of high school and university life. Yet, we are careful to measure the success of our students in more significant ways than test scores and grade-point averages. Although these are worthy goals and our students do quite well according to those measures, our program offers so much more to foster their development as people so that they can make their positive impact on others well after they leave St. Margaret\u2019s. With a focus on the education of the heart, the caring relationships with experienced faculty members help guide students towards the larger life lessons that will guide them throughout their lives. This critical aspect of our curriculum is certainly not delivered in the same manner as a math or English class. There is no textbook and no grade associated with these enduring lessons. They are delivered through authentic relationships, through learning from mistakes, through active self-reflection and mentoring conversations. Ultimately, our purpose is to work closely with students and their families to develop appropriate independence, resiliency and the skills necessary to pursue a meaningful life of learning, leadership and service. Thank you for your interest in St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. Please feel welcome to contact us for additional information as you consider our Middle School program for your family. Sincerely, Michael Allison Middle School Principal Middle School Creed We are committed to honesty, justice, and learning. We respect the dignity and worth of all human beings; their thoughts, feelings, and their individuality. We seek to celebrate and share the joy and creativity that emanate from the love of God. We strive to be responsible and contributing members of our families, our school community, and the world.

Our students thrive through their participation in academic, athletic, artistic, and leadership programs. Middle School Block Schedule The Middle School follows a patterned tumbling block schedule. Each block is 60 minutes long which allows for a variety of learning activities within the block. Breaks are spaced throughout the day so that students never meet for more than two blocks in a row on any given day. The weekly schedule also provides opportunities for the entire Middle School student body, grade levels, and advisory groups to meet each week. These \u201cCommunity Times\u201d are designed to build school culture, engage with our Episcopal identity, provide access to teachers during tutorials, gather grade levels together to talk about specific topics for their grade level, and for advisory groups to meet to focus on our social-emotional curriculum and diversity, equity and inclusion goals. The Middle and Upper Schools follow a similar weekly schedule enabling faculty to teach in both divisions as well as allowing Middle School students to accelerate, when appropriate, into Upper School courses. Middle School Leadership Middle School students are given many opportunities to demonstrate leadership. Opportunities range from formal, elected positions on the Middle School Student Council to student designed and led lunchtime clubs. The culture promotes and encourages student voice and engagement with the school experience. Middle School Service Learning Each grade level in St. Margaret\u2019s Middle School has established themes for its service learning focus of the year. The grade 6 theme is \u201cNavigate our environment.\u201d This theme is a focus of grade level class meetings as the team of sixth grade teachers helps our youngest Middle School students understand the logistics and culture of the Middle School. Their retreat day takes place off campus at the beach where students deepen their advisory bond with each other and their teachers, try new things and enjoy the Tartan community experience. In the fall the grade 6 students serve Second Harvest on the farm, support the all-Middle School project with Head Start Preschool and deepen their understanding and knowledge of the Tartan community and their family history through a cookbook project. The grade 7 theme is \u201cKnow and understand our community.\u201d As seventh graders work to develop their own identity, this theme provides students with opportunities to enhance their empathy and build the skills of cultural competency. With their focus on equity and hunger, the grade level will work with the local Head Start program, Capistrano Senior Living, our St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church and several other community partners. Their fall retreat will take place at the Irvine Spectrum and will allow for advisory groups to really enjoy some fun, quality bonding time together. The grade 8 theme is \u201cRespect the past and influence the future.\u201d Students work throughout the year to understand and support our troops and veterans. Work with our local Operation Help a Hero provides tangible experiences to connect with the needs of our current troops. Veterans Day presentations by local veterans and a project to interview a veteran further connect students to the importance of supporting our troops and honoring our veterans. Their fall retreat will be a day trip to Catalina where sunshine and adventure will pave the way for a fun day of community building. The end of the year class trip to Washington, D.C. provides a meaningful capstone experience. Middle School Chapel The Chapel service is integral to a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Our Episcopal tradition guides that regular participation in communal worship is the key to making individual spirituality blossom. Bringing our expansive diversity of backgrounds from each child into one unified presence in Chapel embraces our differences and creates the habits of prayer, compassion and devotion that are the foundations of worship to all views of a higher power we call God. Students are encouraged to participate in Chapel services in a variety of roles, including acolytes, readers, Eucharistic ministers and speakers. The Middle School attends Chapel services two times a week. Middle School Deans The structure of leadership in the Middle School provides for a dean at each grade level. These grade-level deans play a large role in the culture and communication for their respective grade levels. They organize and run class meetings, help with the cadence and events of advisory meetings, communicate regularly with teachers and students, and have a recognized and valuable voice with the Middle School administration. Due to their close relationship with the students and teachers in a given grade level, the deans are an important point of contact for students, parents, and teachers whenever the need might arise. Middle School Advisory The Middle School Advisory program is designed to provide each student with an adult mentor on campus who knows, cares for, and assists the student in navigating the academic, social and extracurricular experiences in the Middle School. These mixed-gender advisory groups will range in student size from 10-14 students. By being part of an advisory group, students have a guided opportunity to enhance their understanding of themselves, to expand relationships with other students, and to participate in programming that supports physical, social and emotional well-being. Middle School Clubs The Middle School has multiple teacher- and student-led clubs which meet during various lunch periods throughout the school year. These student-driven clubs provide students with the opportunity to organize and engage with an interested group of students. All clubs have a teacher as a support and guide, but the students themselves organize, lead and execute the club meetings. Middle School Tutorial Tutorial is a weekly period designed to allow students to meet with teachers to seek extra help or ask questions on classwork. Sometimes, teachers require students to attend tutorial to make up work, provide further guidance, and to check for content understanding. When students do not need individual time with a teacher, they are able to use tutorial to complete homework, study or work on long-term projects. To prepare students for the Upper School and life beyond, they are given increased freedom in how they choose to use their tutorial time as they progress through the Middle School.

Our Lower School program is designed to prepare your child for a life of learning, leadership and service. In keeping with our mission and guiding force, we focus our program on learning through commitment, leadership through character development, and service through community. Learning Through Commitment St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School is committed to upholding high academic expectations. Our best asset, aside from our students, is our highly educated, caring and professional team of educators. Whether it be our commitment to small class sizes with classroom and special subject teachers engaged in the learning of each child, robust science, technology, engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) programs, our excellence in teaching language arts and the humanities, a vibrant visual arts and music program, or our support in developing the whole child through our training in positive behavior support systems and character education, we continue to grow professionally and adapt our program in order to meet the needs of each and every student at St. Margaret\u2019s. Leadership Through Character Development Our faculty and students are proud to live by the six pillars of the Character Counts program: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship. Our Lower School Student Leadership, faculty and parents work hard to continue to model and teach each of these character traits. Our first weeks of school focus on behavioral expectations for life at St. Margaret\u2019s. Homeroom and Specialist teachers, Co-Teachers, and administrators model and teach these traits and guide students in making good decisions in their social, emotional and academic lives. St. Margaret\u2019s Tartans are taught pro-social behavior as they learn to navigate their ever-changing minds and bodies. We reward this PAWsitive behavior with Class Dojo points, incentives, special privileges and much more. Our professional community instills morals and values in fun and engaging ways. There are spirit days and reward days where the excitement is almost palpable and all the while the children are reminded that PAWsitive character is what great leaders are made of. Service Through Community Our community consists of our students, professional community, and families. We foster an atmosphere in which all feel they have a voice and an integral part in the St. Margaret\u2019s family. We work hard to enhance communication with parents and students through regular face-to-face, web and email-based correspondence. We communicate each child\u2019s progress through the use of a custom-designed \u2018progress report showing achievement toward or above benchmark over time. We host grade-level meetings, parent workshops, and send weekly grade-level newsletters that center on social, emotional, and academic well-being. The students feel a strong sense of community and school spirit through our dynamic Student Leadership groups. Exciting information is shared with our students regarding PAWsitive character events and incentives throughout the year via student-generated videos shown each Monday in Chapel . The administrative team is committed to building strong relationships with all professional community members. These strong relationships then foster a community in which we participate in seasonal and yearlong service learning . These service opportunities are intentionally tied to the social science, science, social justice standards, and social emotional curriculum while also using the themes in the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals . As a St. Margaret\u2019s alumni and parent, I can personally attest to the way our Lower School prepares students for the academic challenges of Middle School , Upper School and university life . Like our Middle School, we are careful to measure the success of our students in more significant ways than just through test scores. We measure our program and the needs of each child through various forms of assessment and use this data to drive instruction. Our program offers so much to foster the development of the whole child. Thank you for your interest in St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. Please feel welcome to contact us for additional information as you consider our Lower School program for your family.

The nearly 400 Lower School students are supported by a low student-to-teacher ratio of credentialed and experienced homeroom teachers and co-teachers, and special subjects teachers who deliver differentiated and individualized instruction to each child. The Lower School program is taught in a traditional setting with the structure of the day built around the developmental age of students at each grade level. All Lower School students begin their day with Chapel, which is a time to join together in community and celebration, and then move through a day filled with core and special subjects, including, art, computer science and engineering, digital literacy, spiritual practice, music, science and physical education. Our teachers are committed to delivering a robust curriculum using research-based strategies and materials. Pro-social behavior is taught and reinforced through the integration of a nationwide Positive Behavioral Support system that is woven into the fabric of our days.

Adjacent to the classrooms for the kindergarten and grade 1 students it serves, the Outdoor Classroom features an edible growing garden, a sand pit, water tables, art stations, small and large building areas, a tricycle loop, reading nooks, an outdoor performance stage, mature trees, an enchanted fairy garden and large playground equipment\u2014swings, tires, and a rope climber. Students are able to explore the Outdoor Classroom during unstructured time throughout the day, and teachers utilize the space as a living laboratory for class time. The Outdoor Classroom nurtures learning in our youngest Lower School students in unique ways. St. Margaret\u2019s has a K-1 Outdoor Classroom teacher who conducts science lessons in the space, in addition to collaborating with St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School visual arts teacher and homeroom teachers to design curriculum and provocations tailored for this unique outdoor setting. Ample unstructured time in outside environments throughout the student\u2019s day also nurtures kinesthetic, creativity, problem solving, interpersonal and critical thinking skills. The Outdoor Classroom fosters gross and fine motor development, and engages multiple senses in the learning process at once, which increases permanence. Time spent in nature, itself, is proven to reduce stress, anxiety, improve observation and causation skills and cognitive focus. The Outdoor Classroom was designed by St. Margaret\u2019s faculty in partnership with the Outdoor Classroom Project, the leader in outdoor education research and innovation for young children, that also supported St. Margaret\u2019s development of the renowned Early Childhood School Outdoor Classroom. The creators envisioned a vibrant, welcoming, thoughtful environment that supports student choice through high-quality, experiential spaces, numerous and varied activities to best optimize the meaningful benefits and facilitate the kind of learning and healthy development in young children that only takes place outdoors. Through the partnership with the Outdoor Classroom Project, St. Margaret\u2019s engages outdoor education experts in ongoing faculty professional development. Lower School Principal Jennifer Blount \u201cWe believe learning occurs everywhere and all of the time. We created the Outdoor Classroom to be as richly and thoughtfully equipped as all our learning environments including traditional indoor classrooms. The Outdoor Classroom and corresponding curriculum for grade K and 1 students reflects St. Margaret\u2019s commitment to the countless and proven benefits of student learning and healthy development through ample time in outdoor, experiential spaces.\u201d Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

Chapel All Lower School students begin their day, Monday \u2013 Thursday, coming together in the peaceful and centering setting of Chapel. They enter the doors and are greeted by teachers and administrators and sit with their classmates and teacher. In the Episcopal tradition, they sing, learn from a daily homily, pray, reflect and start the day anew. All are welcome and encouraged to participate, and often other religious holidays and traditions are observed. St. Margaret\u2019s chaplains incorporate one of our six character words: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship, into the homily messages. There are times each month when homilies are delivered by other members of our professional community. Each Monday, our student leadership teams deliver video presentations including events for the week, character trait reminders, action steps toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and special announcements. Beginning in grade 3, students serve as acolytes, readers, and assist with the Chapel technology. It is just one of many leadership opportunities in the Lower School. Classroom Time Following Chapel, students return to the classroom where they take part in a classroom meeting to connect with their teachers, classmates and the day\u2019s work ahead. The daily schedule is purposefully designed for each grade level to allow for the right amount of consecutive classroom learning as well as breaks throughout the day in the form of snack, recess, lunch and special subject classes. The morning consists of classroom instruction and possibly one of the seven special subject classes: art, computer science and engineering, digital literacy, spiritual practice, music, science and physical education. Students take a break for snack and play time. They participate in a number of outdoor activities during recess and lunch including: basketball, handball, soccer, kickball, builder boards, oversized Legos and wooden blocks, tetherball, reading, or in the Exploration Zone complete with arts and crafts, board games and more. We realize that students need a variety of options to choose from each day during their free time. After recess, most students have a large block for math. The Lower School uses the Everyday Math program including math fact fluency, computer games and extensions. Lunch is followed by another large consecutive block of time for English Language Arts instruction. Kindergarten through grade 5 reading instruction follows Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. These are research-based, student-centered approaches to teaching life-long readers and writers. Interspersed into the daily schedule is the teaching of social and emotional learning in the form of class meetings as well as social sciences taught in thematic units throughout the school year. Classroom Design Lower School classrooms were completely remodeled in 2014, specially designed for young learners. Each classroom is equipped with moveable tables and chairs to foster quick reorganization of the classroom for different kinds of activities and instruction. A classroom can be set in rows facing the front of the classroom, grouped into tables for cooperative work, or even stacked within minutes for a completely open floor in which students can be seated on the carpet for a number of activities. Each classroom has custom designed cubbies or lockers to house student books, sweaters, supplies and personal items. In order to reduce distractions within the classrooms, each room has a \u2018distraction free\u2019 wall in which only the interactive white boards (Promethean) are present. All other items are purposefully beautifully displayed on the thematic bulletin boards around the room. Students use laptops in grades K-2 and one-to-one Surface Tablets in grades 3-5, and classrooms are equipped with document cameras. Pawsitive Tartans! We are committed to the social, emotional and academic growth of each and every child. In terms of social growth, we have adopted the nationwide Positive Behavior Support (PBS) system in which pro-social behavior is thoughtfully taught to each student. Students participate in a \u201cPassport Walk\u201d twice a year. It is during these times, that expected behaviors in the classroom, Chapel, outdoors, on the bus, etc., are reinforced. Students are recognized with PAWsitives whenever they are seen doing the right thing, which is often and all over! They are then able to redeem these PAWsitives for special privileges throughout the year. Lower School News List of 3 news stories.

Our early childhood program is designed to engage the youngest learners to develop socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively through developmentally appropriate practices rich in social connections, language, literacy, math and other disciplinary skills and content. More than 100 years of research has shown us the importance of children\u2019s learning through play and exploration. Current research only solidifies the understanding that children learn best when they are actively and mentally engaged in their own learning. St. Margaret\u2019s knowledgeable and experienced educators facilitate and guide students with well thought strategies and environments that motivate and encourage preschool-age learners to investigate, question, problem solve and discover. In the classroom, children learn to navigate friendships by sharing materials, taking turns and taking perspective of others\u2019 ideas. Cognitive skills are further developed through investigation and exploration. Teachers provide materials and activities that develop literacy, numeracy and scientific thinking. Children are encouraged to question, create, problem-solve and explore. The learning does not end in the classroom. The nationally recognized Outdoor Classroom is purposefully designed for children to discover the natural world by spending time observing and feeding chickens, building with blocks, planting in the garden, catching rollie pollies, and watching caterpillars change over time. The Outdoor Classroom also helps children strengthen their physical abilities through riding bikes, climbing, lifting and dancing. The Early School is a wonderful place for preschool-age learners to develop a foundation for a love of learning through a socially and academically vigorous learning environment. Dr. Cris Lozon, Director, Early School St. Margaret\u2019s Early Childhood School is committed to providing quality care based on our knowledge of current research and best practices. For more than 40 years we have provided quality daily experiences and positive outcomes for preschool children at St. Margaret\u2019s.

Ongoing assessment of children\u2019s progress includes the gathering of anecdotal records, digital photographs, developmental checklists and work samples. Annual speech, hearing and vision screenings in the fall and the results of nationally normed developmental screenings (fall and spring) are added to the child\u2019s portfolio to share with parents at two formal conferences each year. Parents also have an opportunity to participate in assessing their child\u2019s development with a parent-report developmental screen, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. All this information gives us a picture of a child\u2019s development and alerts us if more information and support is needed to help a child reach his or her potential. The St. Margaret\u2019s Early School plans curriculum to support all areas of a child\u2019s development: cognitive, social, emotional, physical and creative. Our curriculum meets or exceeds the California Preschool Learning Foundations, aligns with goals for young children\u2019s learning from the National Association for the Education of Young Children and serves as the foundation for the St. Margaret\u2019s kindergarten curriculum. Learning in preschool is hands-on and integrated. A child\u2019s time outside chasing insects in the garden, for instance, incorporates all the \u201cdispositions for learning\u201d as well as cognitive development: science (\u201cWhat kind of bug is this?\u201d \u201cWhat do they eat?\u201d); math (\u201cIs it larger or smaller than the other one?\u201d \u201cHow many did you find today?\u201d); language (\u201cMonarch Butterflies are orange and black.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s make up a poem about butterflies!\u201d); social skills (\u201cHow can we all see?\u201d \u201cYou can have a turn next.\u201d); physical development (running after the butterfly, carefully stepping around plants, manipulating the butterfly net); and creative (painting a picture of the butterfly in its habitat. Dancing and moving like one.) Learning is everywhere and happening all the time supported by teachers skilled at looking for and creating moments of discovery and learning based on children\u2019s needs and interests. List of 8 items. Art St. Margaret\u2019s Early School offers creative art experiences for children daily in the classroom and Atelier (art studio). Children explore and create using a variety of drawing tools, paints, clay, paper, wire, loose parts, natural items and more. By having art materials available everyday, children gain competence with them and are likely to use them in new and more sophisticated ways. Classroom teachers work closely with the Atelierista (art studio teacher) to extend children\u2019s thinking in the Atelier. The Atelier is a place where children are both artists and scientists as they engage with traditional art materials alongside technology to investigate the natural world, express their ideas, and formulate new questions to further their inquiry. Engaging in art as an expressive language as well as a form in inquiry cultivates and strengthens persistence, creativity, problem solving, and flexibility. It also supports children\u2019s understanding of spatial relationships and physics, perspective and proportion, as well as strengthens development in areas such as fine motor dexterity. From using a digital microscope to look at a flower more closely, to creating a sculpture from clay to be fired in our kiln, the children are offered a wide array of experiences, building a foundation for future art and science thinking. Physical Development We plan fine and gross motor activities each day both inside and outside. St. Margaret\u2019s has a full-time Perceptual Motor Specialist who sets up motor experiences that stimulate the body systems to gain strength, balance and coordination. Activities are planned to meet children\u2019s needs based on observations, collaboration with classroom teachers and developmental assessments . Activities such as using eye droppers and squeeze bottles to water plants, manipulating art materials to create a masterpiece, pouring and measuring for cooking activities and playing with playhouse people are the foundation skills that build strength in muscles used for writing. Through motor activities the children will: Gain confidence and good body image Learn to control eye-hand coordination Develop fine motor dexterity and control as a foundation for writing Demonstrate balance and control during loco-motor movements Use muscles to manipulate objects and control environment Dramatic Play/Drama Children don\u2019t need much encouragement to pretend and engage in dramatic play. It is second nature to them. They\u2019ll create it in the playhouse (in or outside) in the sandbox, with unit blocks and animals and people inside, with the hollow blocks and hard hats outside, on bikes, in the garden... everywhere! In dramatic play, the children will: Use their creativity and imagination Work out fears and worries Sort through their understandings of fantasy and reality Try on roles, learn about their world Enhance vocabulary and receptive (listening) and expressive (speaking) language skills Gain the ability to plan, organize & clean up! Develop focus and concentration Practice self-regulation and problem-solving Explore concepts of \u201cfair\u201d and practice turn-taking, cooperation and sharing Use symbolic thought Retell and reenact events in stories Language & Literacy Books (story books, non-fiction or poetry) are read to children each day at group time and one-on-one throughout the day both inside and outside. Children have flannel board stories to retell favorites or create their own. Children make individual or class books to document experiences and celebrate the imagination. We provide children with opportunities for meaningful conversations with us and each other throughout the day. Through dramatic play, table top games, group time activities and casual conversations with teachers and each other, the children will: Practice listening, asking and responding to questions Be encouraged to express ideas, develop age-appropriate grammar and learn new vocabulary Develop phonemic and phonological awareness by: playing with the sounds of words, matching sounds and rhymes, clapping out syllables, predicting story outcomes Identify the alphabet as a special category of symbols Recognize beginning letters in familiar words and associate letters with sounds Discover that letters make up words and words make up sentences Begin to think of themselves as authors by beginning to understand that books are \u201ctalk written down\u201d, Listen to and make up their own stories and poems Enjoy representing their own ideas through drawing or dictation Experiment with writing to communicate ideas, including writing their name Move along the reading continuum Mathematics Math is everywhere\u2014inside and outside. Children love to count and compare things. Through blocks, science and nature activities, dramatic play, art, music and movement the children will build foundation skills in arithmetic, geometry and algebra. The children will: Show 1-to-1 correspondence as part of counting and numeracy skills 0-9 Understand and demonstrate concepts of more and less Demonstrate understanding of sets and ordering (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) Recognize and manipulate basic shapes and discover spatial relationships Classify and sort by attributes (color, size, shape) Extend and create patterns Learn by making estimations and graphs Experiment with measurement (standard and unconventional) Learn and have fun! Music The St. Margaret\u2019s Early School music program strives to nurture a joy of music making in students and to foster an appreciation of natural and found sounds in our students\u2019 environments. Students are introduced to the rudiments of melody, harmony, and rhythm; central tenements to building a solid foundation in music appreciation and music making. Learning Objectives : Melody: Learning about call and response patterns Recognition of symbols and how they are used to notate and form melodic patterns Learning about high sounds and low sounds Differentiating between loud sounds and soft sounds Encouraging students to create their own melodies and recognize that melodies can be found anywhere. Listening to different types of melodies from different parts of the world. Harmony: Helping students to recognize and describe the experience of putting different sounds together. Learning to sing in rounds Encouraging students to experiment with superimposing melodies onto one another and describing the sounds through artwork or physical expression. Listening to how different musical mediums (i.e. brass quartet versus choral singing) present different types of harmonies. Rhythm: Learning to recognize \u201cfeeling the beat\u201d in music and what that makes our bodies feel. Having children play in instrument or drum circles to encourage collective improvisation, performance leadership, and artistic confidence. Introduction of basic rhythmic nomenclature: quarter note (ta), half note (ta-ah), eighth notes (ta-ka), and rests (beats of silence). Encouraging students to write their own rhythms using their own musical language. Dancing to different types of rhythms from different parts of the world. Learning different tempo markings; different fast and slow sounds. Instructional Methods : Direct whole group instruction in our outdoor classroom. Using different instruments to demonstrate different sounds and concepts. Digital, video, and sound presentations Having open discussions with students about digital, video, and sound presentations. Guiding students to develop their own personal, creative tools and vocabulary to share their artistic expression. Encouraging the physical manifestations of what music makes our bodies feel. Encouraging students to embrace the joy of collaborative and collective music making. Making field trips to the St. Margaret\u2019s Performing Arts Center (PAC) and engaging with the varying music and performing arts disciplines (i.e. orchestra, band, choir) Engaging parents in talking about music at home by giving students mini music activities they can do at home with their parents Can you create a cooking dinner with dad playlist? What sound effects or little music jingles can you and mom create while reading your bed time story(ies)? Will your siblings help you and your stuffed animals create a puppet show at home with sound effects and self-composed music? Inviting guest artists and teachers to showcase different mediums of music making. Working towards documenting music learning by putting on a student led performance Performance ideas: puppet show, music concert, musical theatre review, art exhibit of how music makes us feel, dance concerts with different genres of music. Science Our Outdoor Classroom provides a rich opportunity for the young scientist. Through time spent in nature (observing and tending plants in our garden, the chickens in the barnyard and insects), activities with earth (sand and dirt), wind and water, watching weather, making bubbles, cooking and watching transformations of matter, the children will: Learn to be careful observers Develop the scientific method by making predictions and asking questions Collect, describe and record information Recognize cause and effect Acquire respect for the natural environment Develop a scientific vocabulary Learn and have fun! Social & Emotional Development Embedded in St. Margaret\u2019s Core Values, children develop social emotional skills through understanding character, community, breadth and balance, high expectations, and equity and inclusion. Kindergarten teachers nation-wide say that self-regulation is critical for early school success. Through building trust, interacting with peers and teachers, engaging in activities and games with their peers, creating scenarios through dramatic play and just by being part of a group, the children will: Learn to separate from family and be happy away from home Gain independence and confidence Gain an appropriate attention span in order to: Choose and follow through on activities they choose Stay with and complete activities the teacher chooses Develop self-control and self-regulation skills Be able to follow 3 simple rules We keep ourselves safe We keep others safe We keep our belongings safe Learn to be part of a group by Understanding the consequences of own behavior Learning to take turns, share and cooperate Expressing feelings Solving problems without adult intervention Learn and have fun!

Andrews Outdoor Classroom Named for Faculty Emeritus Ingrid S. Andrews, a 35-year founding faculty member and longtime ES director, is the centerpiece of the Early School campus. It is a place where young learners can immerse themselves in nature, hone observation skills, practice persistence and cooperation, develop academic concepts and physical skills and learn problem solving skills and, of course\u2014play and have fun. The first school in Orange County to be designated with a \u201cRecognized Outdoor Classroom Site\u201d by the Outdoor Classroom Project *, the ES Outdoor Classroom is a science lab, artist\u2019s studio, a library, symphony hall, theater and gym. Inspired by the work about nature deficit disorder from author Richard Louv, St. Margaret\u2019s commitment to providing an outdoor environment and curriculum that nurtures growth and learning for the whole child. All children need and benefit from abundant time outdoors positively impacting development and learning and critical for physical health. For children ages 0 to 5, development and learning outdoors is often easier, more productive and beneficial. Full development and integration of outdoor and indoor programs creates the optimal learning and growing environment for young children. The outdoor learning program promotes healthy lifestyle for young children, creates a respect for the earth and provides inviting spots for play and learning. All Early School classrooms open to the Outdoor Classroom where students spend much of their day. Learning by doing in an outdoor environment supports physical, social and emotional growth, as well as growth across the curriculum: math, science, language and literacy, social studies, art, music and drama. Being outside nurtures the dispositions for learning (creativity, persistence, collaboration, problem solving and communication) that we know leads to lifelong learning. *The Outdoor Classroom Project was created by the Child Educational Center, a nationally accredited program of early childhood education which cultivated the concept and practice of Outdoor Classrooms. To receive the designation of a Recognized Outdoor Classroom Site, St. Margaret\u2019s Early Childhood School faculty attended a series of classes over several years, undertook a self-study, made a commitment to the Outdoor Classroom philosophy and passed a site evaluation by members of the Outdoor Classroom Project Board of Directors.

As a college-preparatory institution that sends off many of its graduates to further study STEAM areas in college, St. Margaret\u2019s offers a challenging STEAM curriculum and program that prepares students for future careers in a variety of fields. Programs such as computer science and engineering begin at a young age and build year over year, engaging our students in a love of STEAM disciplines and challenging them to reach their highest potential. Increasingly, our academic team has put a stronger emphasis on integrating the curriculum so that students can experience projects similar to how they are incorporated into STEAM fields in the industry. Among other innovative methods, we have incorporated the use of the design thinking process from Stanford University\u2019s d.school, that is critical to creation, innovation and invention. St. Margaret\u2019s STEAM program serves our students\u2019 natural interest, engages them through experiential, project-based curriculum, allows them to make sense of the technological world, builds critical and creative thinking and higher-order reasoning skills, and prepares them for college majors and careers in science, technology, engineering and math fields.

Early study of computer science and engineering at St. Margaret\u2019s is a unique opportunity to leverage the inherent predispositions of these digital natives growing up in a technologically enriched world. All students today must be digitally literate from a young age to successfully navigate school years into adulthood. Further, we know that our ever-evolving technological world needs future generations of computer scientists, engineers and programmers who will identify opportunities and create solutions only they can envision. St. Margaret\u2019s offers a comprehensive and advanced computer science curriculum grades Kindergarten through 12. The academic study of computer science and engineering begins in Kindergarten and focuses on robotics, simple machines and computer coding. Robotics and simple machines are an excellent tool for introducing and exploring engineering, stimulating imaginative thinking and providing real world meaning to otherwise abstract concepts through hands-on learning. In Kindergarten and grade 1, students begin basic programming with the use of Bee-Bots, a programmable floor robot, acquiring sequencing, strategizing and problem-solving skills . Students in grades 1 -6 move on to more advanced LEGO Robotics. Students begin with the essentials, learning about the benefits of simple machines such as levers, pulleys, gears, wheels and axles. They work with partners to build a robot from pre-defined directions and then move to a challenge, creating their own robot working within a set of parameters to create a solution. Building and programming robots introduces and fosters critical computational thinking skills behind programming of identifying a problem, breaking it down into smaller pieces, developing a strategy or algorithm to solve it, and troubleshooting when it doesn\u2019t work as expected. It also nurtures collaboration with other students, persistence and creativity. In addition to coding with Bee-Bots, computer programming continues to instill computational thinking with Scratch Jr., a graphical computer programming language, taught in grades K \u2013 2. In grades 3 \u2013 4, students build on basic coding skills advancing to Scratch, a block based visual programming language. In grades 5 \u2013 6, students combine their knowledge of robotics and coding, to program their own robot to perform a variety of tasks using LEGO Mindstorm. In the Middle School, grades 7 and 8, students transition from graphical programming to text-based programming using the language LUA, coding with the app Codea on their iPads. The computer science curriculum advances in the Upper School with higher level computer programming classes in three different computer languages, Processing, Python and Java. Students can then move on to two Advanced Placement courses, AP computer programming and AP computer principles, as well as two post-AP courses, software engineering and mobile apps development.

Our students require and thrive in technology-rich, dynamic learning environments. St. Margaret\u2019s continues to evolve and reimagine learning spaces across our campus and bring leading technology and tools to meet the needs of these digital natives. Our state-of-the-art computing environment and robust wireless infrastructure throughout our 22-acre campus provide students access to robust resources that support their digital literacy and teaching and learning across all disciplines. The classrooms at St. Margaret\u2019s are modern, technology-enriched learning spaces that allow for heightened connectivity to networks, interactivity among devices in the room, wireless display capabilities, and collaboration among students, teachers and even outside experts relevant to a learning experience. Our professional community has demonstrated a clear ability to rethink pedagogy and curriculum with an aim toward using technology to enhance the learning experience and prepare students for learning and working in the technology world, whether through unique course offerings or enhancing learning in traditional subjects. St. Margaret\u2019s also recognizes that an increasingly high-tech world means an increased need for education around digital citizenship and responsible use of technology. St. Margaret\u2019s has partnered with multiple organizations around this topic, including The Social Institute and Common Sense Media. Bringing education around technology use into the classroom ensures that our students are empowered to strike a healthy balance with technology and positively portray oneself online in order to be good digital citizens that make the world a better place. In addition to classroom technology, St. Margaret\u2019s also has innovative classroom labs to further technology-specific education. This includes the iLab as part of the Lower School STEAM Center, a computer science lab in the Middle School, and a computer science and robotics lab in the Library which houses design and fabrication tools and is home to programs such as robotics and esports. St. Margaret\u2019s also has technology carts for educational programming in virtual reality and augmented reality, with educational touchpoints around these tools and makerspaces continuing to expand. St. Margaret\u2019s students also have a device program where K-8 students are issued school-provided iPads at the beginning of the school year. In this program, every Lower School and Middle School student receive their own iPad, with Middle School students having the privilege to take their device home for homework and studying. Through this program, St. Margaret\u2019s oversees the learning applications downloaded to the device, helping teachers streamline activities and assignments using platforms that all students have. The Upper School, meanwhile, has a bring-your-own-device model, where students can use a device they may already be comfortable with as an aid for studying and learning.

It\u2019s an outdoor science lab and a social meeting hub. It is a place where classroom learning and experiential education converge. This all-school garden is a place where students learn concepts with far wider application than growing a vegetable for the first time or watching soil decompose to make renewed, nutritious earth. Rather the focus can be on understanding delayed gratification, waiting for that one perfect strawberry to turn a deep shade of red, or the role that life cycles play in our interconnectedness. The school garden is an outdoor classroom where students engage their intellectual curiosity and are encouraged to discover something new. This leads to a sense of wonder and appreciation for our natural world, and a commitment to preserving and protecting these experiences for others. Each season the garden transitions to the next with the help of students and faculty, to be a lively space where edible food is the byproduct of hard work, patience, and science. Vegetables, such as beets, broccoli, snap peas, squash, lettuce, radishes and carrots are harvested. Students savor the taste of something they had a hand in growing, this is the ultimate connection. Sometimes, the Garden\u2019s harvest is donated to local organizations, adding service to the learning that takes place.

Appreciate art as a creative and critical process.

Students in the Early Childhood School and Lower School may enroll in the St. Margaret's Dance Conservatory, where they take age-appropriate classes in ballet, hip hop and tap, after school. Middle and Upper School students may take dance to fulfill both their P.E. and their Fine Arts Credits as part of their regular school day. In the Upper School there are two levels of dance offered. Students in these classes study and perform in a variety of genres including ballet, tap, jazz, contemporary, and hip-hop technique. Dance classes also include yoga and Pilates-based conditioning to increase flexibility and strength. Instruction focuses on correct postural alignment, coordination, rhythmic patterns, fundamental dance positions, dance history and terminology. These courses emphasize essential life skills such as concentration, self-discipline, precision, goal-setting, confidence-building, self-expression, teamwork, effective communication and responsibility. The Dance Program produces two All-School Dance Concerts each year, which showcase both faculty and student choreography. Students are also introduced to the art of choreography and encouraged to creatively express themselves through guided exercises and group projects. Theater Theater at St. Margaret's is a process-oriented, experientially-based program available to students in grades 1 through 12. In the Lower School, dramatic play in the classroom sows the seeds of exploring the world of drama. Children participate in acting out stories, their own stories and ones from classroom literature. The Lower School produces two full-scale musicals with an open casting policy; every child who wishes to participate receives a role. The Lower School has a musical for students in grades 4 and 5 and another musical for students in grades 2-3. In the Middle School, every student in grade 6 takes theater, in a rotating schedule with other enrichment courses. Students in grades 7 and 8 may enroll in theater, a semester-long elective. The Middle School musical and play offers students opportunities to participate not only as actors, but in backstage and technical positions as well. The Upper School offers four University of California approved classes: Theater, Intermediate Theater, Advanced Theater and Honors Theater. Over the course of the academic year, there are two full theater productions, including a drama and a musical. The technical and design positions are held almost entirely by students in the Upper School. St. Margaret's also participates in the Cappies, a national Critics and Awards Program for High School Theater and the MACY Awards. Music St. Margaret\u2019s offers comprehensive ensemble music programs for students in grades 4 through 12 that start with beginning classes all the way up to standard concert groups that rehearse and perform great works of music literature. Instruction in each discipline combines classroom interaction with technology-supported learning tools. All of our ensembles have two major concert performances each year in December and April, along with additional performing opportunities in collaboration with musical theater productions, chapel services, and other St. Margaret\u2019s community functions. Music Program Offerings List of 3 items. Band The Band Program offers a two-year introductory sequence in concert band instruments in the Lower School (oboe, flute, clarinet, bassoon, saxophones, trumpet, trombone, french horn, tuba, percussion) that combines individual instruction with ensemble practice and performance through a curriculum based on the Essential Elements 2000 series. The Middle School Band has both grade-level and combined rehearsals each week. The Upper School Concert Band studies and performs major works from the wind ensemble repertoire. The Upper School Jazz Combo is an advanced group focusing on small-ensemble training and improvisation in the performance of Jazz standards. Choir The Choir Program begins in the Lower School, with rudimentary training in solf\u00e8ge, diaphragmatic breathing, posture and improvisational singing. Students are exposed to repertoire in many different genres and time periods, as well the opportunity to sing in several different languages. The Middle School choir continues this training at a more advanced level, as well as affording students more solo opportunities. Choir at this level also offers an auditioned choral experience with the Tartan Chorale, open to all students in the Middle School. This ensemble meets once per week, studying more advanced repertoire and providing a more focused experience in true choral singing. The Upper School Highlander Chorale is a co-curricular class, designed to give the average and advanced singer the skills necessary to become adept at singing in many styles and genres. Students learn more advanced techniques of proper vocal production and have varied experiences in ensemble and solo singing. Chorale also provides students with a strong sense of commitment to the ensemble and pride in working together toward long- and short-range goals. Orchestra The Orchestra Program offers a comprehensive ensemble experience for students in every division at St. Margaret's. The Lower School String Orchestra combines individual instruction with ensemble practice and performance through a multifaceted curriculum that focuses on developing strong basic skills in music literacy and the interpretation of music. The Middle School Orchestra offers introductory training in the symphonic tradition of Haydn and Mozart to string, woodwind, brass, and percussion students. The Upper School Orchestra explores a vast symphonic repertoire starting with Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Schubert. Finally, Chamber Music offers advanced students the opportunity to study Sonatas, Piano Trios, String Quartets, Wind Quintets, and more. Annually, orchestra ensembles at the school regularly collaborate with theater, band and choir. Music Studies List of 3 items. Advanced Placement Music Theory The formal study of music theory gives students a thorough background in which to develop the ability to recognize, understand, and describe the basic materials and processes of music that are heard or presented in a score. The achievement of these goals is approached by initially addressing fundamental aural, analytical, and compositional skills using both listening and written exercises. Building on this foundation, the course progresses to include more creative tasks such as the harmonization of a melody by selecting appropriate chords, composing a musical bass line to provide two-voice counterpoint, and the realization of figured-bass notation. Subjects covered include melody, harmony, texture, rhythm, form, musical analysis, elementary composition, and to some extent, history and style along with Musicianship skills such as dictation, sight-singing, and keyboard harmony. This course makes use of the Practica Musica education training software. Early Childhood Our early childhood program in music for students in preschool through grade 3 introduces students to the world of music through an organized series of presentations, games, and hands-on activities that promote an awareness and appreciation for the art form. Music basics are taught that allow students a seamless transition into our ensemble music programs beginning in grade 4. Private Instruction Beyond ensemble training, our music staff also offers optional one-on-one weekly lessons for students in every subject. We encourage our students to take private lessons on campus to augment their skills and improve the quality of their ensemble experience.

At the core of the St. Margaret\u2019s art experience is developing one\u2019s personal passions. In a studio art environment, students are given choice and agency while partnering with experienced arts educators. As students develop the tools to express themselves, they often find that they are also on a journey of self-discovery. No matter what path students take, whether looking to shape and influence their world or to simply have a place to decompress, it is our hope that everyone has a space they can call their own to figure out what matters most to them. The Visual Arts faculty\u2019s philosophy is to make everyone feel they are meant to be here and do this creative work together. We feel creating spaces that make students feel supported and remind them why wonder, exploration, and creative thought matter, not only nurtures students but also creates more engagement, thoughtful conversations, and perhaps more meaningful artwork. We hope students' creative acts are seen on a daily basis in a way that self-expression becomes part of a balanced and well-lived life. Student artwork is on display throughout the campus year-round. Visual Arts exhibitions include the Fall Art Show, the annual K-12 Student Art Show showcasing more than 200 pieces of student work, the Scholastic online exhibit, and the Senior AP Art Pop-Up Show. St. Margaret's visual art students regularly participate in the OC Art of the Year contest, the National K-12 Ceramics Exhibition, the Scholastic Art and Writing contest, and Young Arts. Students also engage with professional artists as part of an artist-in-residence program and go on art trips to gain real-world experience. Visual Arts Course Offerings List of 4 items. Lower School Students in the Lower School experience Visual Art, one day a week, with the Lower School art teacher. Extra projects and after-school programs are available.

The Darcy Rice Center for the Arts, designated an All-Steinway School for Excellence, is first and foremost a teaching and learning facility supporting instrumental music, choral music, dance and theater education and programs in dedicated learning environments that have been designed with each artistic discipline in mind. Two professional performance theaters provide optimum venues to spotlight student talent across all performing arts disciplines.

Dusk 5 Dusk 6 Theater-5 All-Steinway Designation Upon the opening of the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts in August 2012, St. Margaret\u2019s received the prestigious distinction as an All-Steinway School from Steinway & Sons, builders of the finest pianos in the world. According to Steinway & Sons, to earn the distinction of an All-Steinway School, an institution must demonstrate a commitment to excellence by providing its students and faculties with the best equipment possible for the study of music. All pianos owned by All-Steinway Schools, from the practice room to the recital hall, are designed by Steinway & Sons. Each Steinway-designed piano in the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts was new and delivered when the center opened in August 2012. Among St. Margaret\u2019s collection is a Steinway Model D Concert Grand Piano for the Marcus D. Hurlbut Theater, three Steinway-designed 5\u2019 10\u201d Performance Edition Boston Grand Pianos that outfit the Choir Room and Concert Band Room and the Orchestra Room. Additionally, there is a new Performance Edition Institutional upright Boston Piano in each of the Performing Arts Center\u2019s 11 practice rooms. When presenting St. Margaret\u2019s the distinction, President of Steinway & Sons Ron Losby said, \u201cIt truly is my honor to be here and after what I have just seen briefly walking through this extraordinary facility, I am humbled by having our name attached to such a beautiful school.

Over the next thirty years, Henry and his sons, C. F. Theodore, Charles, Henry Jr., William, and Albert, developed the modern piano. They built their pianos one at a time, applying skills that were handed down from master to apprentice, generation after generation. Today, Steinway still builds pianos that way. Each Steinway grand piano, for example, takes nearly a year to create. Nothing is hurried. Even the carefully selected woods employed in the rims, tops, soundboards, and actions cure for months in its yard, kilns and conditioning rooms, until they stabilize at a rigidly specified moisture content. Steinway is dedicated to the ideal of making the finest pianos in the world. The result is instruments renowned for their unsurpassed quality. Pianos with such superior sound and responsive touch that they enchant the most demanding pianists. Steinway pianos are preferred overwhelmingly by people who share the joy of playing and owning the finest musical instrument. To view the list of All-Steinway Schools, please click here . PRESIDENT OF STEINWAY & SONS RON LOSBY \u201cOut of the 150 All-Steinway schools throughout the world, I can only think of one who is in a similar category to St. Margaret\u2019s. Most of them are schools such as the Curtis Institute of Music, the Royal College of Music, or the Beijing Central Conservatory; they\u2019re extraordinary institutions in their own right because they are dedicated to excellence. And, this obviously is the case here at St. Margaret\u2019s as well.\" St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

An ardent supporter of the athletic programs, John Balak's friendly smile and encouraging word will forever be etched in the minds of the athletes who were fortunate enough to know him. The recipient of this award is the person that the coaches of St. Margaret's feel best emulates the life and perspective of this fine man. The John Balak Award winner is unselfish, dedicated to their sport and school, and models a work ethic that every coach desires from his athletes. The student is an athlete that demonstrates respect for his/her teammates, coaches, and the opposing team. The individual is fiercely competitive but makes the distinction between hatred and competition. The most important trait the John Balak Award winner emulates is integrity. You can count on this person to give it their best, to take responsibility for their performance, and to praise their teammates for a win.

Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens through formal and informal opportunities that work to advance justice on behalf of all members of our community and the world. In all aspects of their school lives, St. Margaret's students are provided leadership opportunities and are able to initiate, explore, and practice leadership skills in a safe and encouraging environment. Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens and leaders through formal and informal opportunities. Leadership development in our students is actively promoted across all divisions at the classroom, division and school-wide levels through a cohesive program of leadership opportunities and development at the school. Students have the opportunity to demonstrate leadership on the athletic field, on stage, in service, or to better the culture and climate of the school community. Leadership, however, is not just traditional class positions that students can fill each year. Students feel empowered to identify their own leadership opportunities. Students discover that leadership is about finding their voice, mobilizing others, humility, and working hard, among other things, and that these are skills that will set them up for a life of positive impact. St. Margaret\u2019s students do not sit passively, but rather demonstrate their character and actively seek ways to better themselves, our school community and beyond. Leadership opportunities are abundant across all divisions and are developmentally paced for increasing responsibility, decision-making and voice. Students practice and demonstrate leadership in deliberate and meaningful ways as they move through the divisions from Preschool to Upper School. They learn citizenship in the Preschool and understand the importance of helping a friend and being fair, rise to the opportunity to be big buddy in Lower School, create a student club in the Middle School or offer a powerful address on an important topic in Upper School Convocation and organize support around it. St. Margaret\u2019s students respond to issues and needs, and they engage with one another with respect and admiration and distinguish themselves among their peers and beyond the St. Margaret\u2019s campus.

Our community believes that an essential outcome of St. Margaret\u2019s education is that students and graduates feel the compassion, responsibility and calling to serve others and be active and contributing citizens within their communities and the world. Our Episcopal identity guides our service learning program that aims to create understanding of community issues and challenges, engender empathy for others, nurture deeper connections and engagement, build cultural competency and life skills. Service learning and begins with developmentally-appropriate activities in the Early School and builds through the Upper School years. Service learning at St. Margaret's is experiential and requires students to understand the authentic needs of the community they are serving. Often service learning is tied to the content of our academic curriculum, making the service even more relevant and deepening the learning experience in a real setting. We emphasize and model the importance of service by purposefully taking time in the school day within all divisions and as an all-school community for service learning projects, rather than require students to count service hours accumulated after school or on weekends. St. Margaret\u2019s has formed long-term partnerships with local non-profit organizations and leverages these sustained relationships to further their missions within the communities they serve, and to provide powerful learning experiences for our students. Partner organizations include Family Assistance Ministries, The Ecology Center, Operation Help A Hero and the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, Padres Unidos, Second Harvest Food Bank, The Infant Pantry and Welcome INN. The lessons of these kinds of hands-on service experiences leave students with a new understanding of societal issues and inequities; underlining, systemic causes; and deep personal connections to the rewards of investing in and giving back to the community.

Episcopal schools are not solely communities for Christians, rather as ecumenical and diverse ministries of educational and human formation for people of all faiths and backgrounds. Episcopal schools also integrate religious and spiritual formation into the curriculum and life of the school community. Episcopal schools exist not merely to educate, but to demonstrate and proclaim the unique worth and beauty of all human beings. Chapel at St. Margaret's Led by St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School chaplains, Chapel is an integral part of the student experience for every student, nurturing character, grace, community fellowship and spiritual wellness. Every student participates in Chapel services weekly as a dedicated time in the school schedule for proclamation, celebration, solace and reflection of God\u2019s goodness and unconditional love. Chapel services and the Church campus, including the Fountain Courtyard, meditation labyrinth and garden, are sacred and safe spaces always open to students and members of the St. Margaret\u2019s community. Chapel also reinforces the sacred in ourselves and everything around us, and encourages taking time to pause, reflect and appreciate personal truth and life\u2019s authentic joys. It develops mindfulness and a deeper connection with individual spirituality and respect and care for others. The student body and professional community of each division gather as a community for Chapel as a part of the weekly schedule\u2014Early Childhood School gathers weekly, Lower School begins Monday through Thursday with Chapel, Middle School gathers twice a week and Upper School once a week. Readings, prayers and homilies are thoughtfully selected and developed by the chaplains to reflect life and the multiple faiths within the school community. Students have leadership opportunities to serve as acolytes or readers, and offer a homily that reflects upon the reading, and musical or dance performances. Through the tradition of Chapel, students also learn and practice the proper respect and decorum of a sacred space and learn to appreciate its place and value in their lives.

Each student is assigned an advisor, with Middle School students getting a new advisor each school year, while Upper School students keep the same advisor for four years beginning in grade 9. Students view their advisor as a mentor, a personal cheerleader, or someone who could guide them if a challenge arises. The school views the advisor as the person on campus who knows and best cares for each student and will be a trusted counselor and supporter. Advisory groups meet weekly to discuss current adolescent topics and social issues, reflect on guest speakers and school topics, perform service-learning projects, guide academic progress, and to simply connect with one another. The advisory groups become a constant, tight-knit, school family for each student. The advisory structure also provides a framework for students to be involved in Chapel, school-wide events, and retreats both on and off campus. Advisors seek to know the students beyond the classroom, and serve as a liaison for their parents, teachers, coaches and administrators to work together for the benefit of the student.

The Annual Fund is the primary charitable vehicle for the St. Margaret\u2019s community to provide resources that are put to work immediately to support the school, our faculty, and our students. Your gift to the school supports every critical area and every program we offer. Why the Annual Fund? As the most important annual fundraising priority, the Annual Fund provides immediate resources needed for the academic year that cannot be found elsewhere. The Annual Fund is one of the school\u2019s primary sources of operating income and as such ensures the strength and success of our programs. Through St. Margaret\u2019s history, our families have been the ones who made the greatest difference by investing their time to build our community and their treasure to build our school. Each generation of Tartans benefits from this legacy of generosity. We believe in 100% parental investment at all levels \u2013 including philanthropy \u2013 and each year, we ask all families to give to the school through the Annual Fund. How much each family contributes is a personal decision. Gifts typically range from $25 to $25,000 \u2013 a wide range that underscores the importance of each gift that results from the generous nature of our community. All gifts are greatly appreciated and each makes an impact on our students\u2019 experience at St. Margaret\u2019s. The only gift too small is no gift at all! List of 11 frequently asked questions. What is the Annual Fund? The Annual Fund, St. Margaret\u2019s annual giving program, supports nearly every aspect of a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Participation in this program at any level demonstrates our community\u2019s belief in our school\u2019s commitment to preparing students and fulfilling its mission. In fact, the strength of St. Margaret\u2019s and its programs is a direct result of the collective effort of alumni, parents, faculty, staff and friends who participate every year in the Annual Fund. The Annual Fund provides immediate, flexible resources to help fund the school\u2019s highest priorities \u2013technology, sports, visual and performing arts, financial aid, faculty support, campus renewal, etc. Can Annual Fund gifts be restricted? Unrestricted gifts to the Annual Fund are strongly encouraged, as they allow us to direct resources to the areas of greatest need or in response to a special opportunity. Gifts to the Annual Fund may be restricted only if they cover an existing operating expense in a board approved budget. St. Margaret\u2019s has designated ten areas of donor opportunities as follows: \u00b7 General School Opportunities \u00b7 Early Childhood School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Lower School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Middle School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Upper School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Educational Support Services \u00b7 School Administration \u00b7 Facility Costs \u00b7 Financial Aid \u00b7 Arts and Athletics Why is it important to have a high percentage of families participating in the Annual Fund? Participation is the most important part of the Annual Fund. Every participating family makes a difference. When foundations and corporations consider schools for grants, one of their first questions is the percentage of families that contribute to the Annual Fund. Your Annual Fund support is a quantifiable measure of the \u201chealth\u201d of the school, and organizations use this measurement, among others, to decide whether St. Margaret\u2019s is a good investment. With more than 8,000 preschool through Grade 12 independent day schools in the United States, your participation helps to make St. Margaret\u2019s an outstanding choice for grants from foundations and corporations. I already pay a lot for tuition. Why do I need to also give to the Annual Fund? The Annual Fund helps keep tuition fees from increasing too drastically or at all. Without support to the Annual Fund, tuition may have to be greatly increased and/or certain programs and extracurricular student activities may need to be cut. The Annual Fund is an additional investment in the education of each child at St. Margaret\u2019s and an important source of revenue to guarantee the financial health of the school. How much should I give? If we were to answer in dollars, the answer is different for each family. Reflect for a moment on the importance to each student of her or his experiences at St. Margaret\u2019s. Our school as it is today: the high educational standards, the strength of our arts, athletics and clubs, the state-of-the-art science equipment and classroom smart boards, has been made possible by more than two decades of charitable gifts received from the current and past generosity of current and former parents, parents of alumni, grandparents, trustees, and friends. So when it comes to deciding how much to give, we ask that you consider the importance you place on the tangibles listed above, the education your child receives thanks to Annual Fund support, and your family\u2019s circumstances. We ask that you consider giving generously based on all of these. Please remember: every gift makes a difference. I prefer to give later in the year. Why should I pledge my support in the fall? Annual Fund contributions directly affect our operating budget. We regularly reevaluate our budget and make adjustments if funding is not on track. A pledge is a commitment to make a gift. By letting us know in the fall that we can count on your support this year, we can budget accordingly and ensure that all of our programs and activities are fully funded. Pledges can be paid any time before the end of our fiscal year on June 30. How does the Annual Fund benefit my child? Every child at St. Margaret's Episcopal School benefits directly from the gifts made to the annual fund. Whether the funds are spent on enrichment, extracurricular activities, advanced learning opportunities, or information technology, the Annual Fund allows us to provide the finest education for each and every student at St. Margaret's \u2013 from Early Childhood School through Grade 12. Remember that you are making a charitable contribution and that your gift is tax deductible as allowed by law. What is the best way to make a gift to the Annual Fund? There are many options for making your gift: \u00b7 You may make a secure credit card donation online at smes.org/annual-fund. \u00b7 Checks made out to St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School can be mailed to the advancement office, Attention \u201cAnnual Fund,\u201d at 31641 La Novia, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675. \u00b7 You can make a gift stock (please contact the advancement office or visit smes.org/giving for information on the transfer of stock). \u00b7 Many companies also provide matching gift programs for employees who make charitable gifts. When you make a gift to the Annual Fund, check to see if there is a matching gift program at your workplace that can additionally benefit the school. Is my gift tax-deductible? Yes! Your gift to the Annual Fund is tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. You will receive a letter thanking you and acknowledging your gift, which can be used as a receipt for tax purposes. I volunteer a lot of time at St. Margaret's. Doesn't that matter as much as giving money? St. Margaret\u2019s relies heavily on its parent volunteers to help with virtually every aspect of our school. From board members and classroom volunteers to PTF members and hot lunch volunteers, you play a critical role in the life of our school. Your financial support is another important venue to make a significant impact on the life of the school and the future of the children at St. Margaret\u2019s. Does the Annual Fund support ___________? Yes! The Annual Fund supports every area at St. Margaret\u2019s \u2013 the ones most important to you and your children, and those you may have not really thought about. Every aspect of our program is important to the development of the whole child \u2013 our annual fund is designed to support it all, so we can provide opportunities for all. Give Now!

The Annual Fund directly impacts every aspect of the school and each student\u2019s experience. It provides for the margin of excellence in all that we do.

TALE ensures that all current and future Tartans needing financial support can have the gift of a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, the goal is to grow TALE to the point that every Tartan\u2019s demonstrated need is perpetually met. Give to TALE Alumni Giving FAQ List of 8 frequently asked questions. What is TALE? TALE supports St. Margaret\u2019s Financial Aid program for current and future Tartans. It is the only endowment fund at St. Margaret\u2019s that is both driven by alumni and solely focused on helping fund financial aid. Ultimately, the goal is to have TALE serve as St. Margaret\u2019s primary source of financial aid funding, ensuring that all students can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of their financial background. How much each alumnus contributes is a personal decision. Alumni have historically given $1 to $5,000. However, each gift makes a difference, regardless of its size, and every generation of Tartan will benefit from your generosity. Who benefits from TALE? St. Margaret\u2019s provides financial aid to more than 150 Tartans each year, totaling ~$5 million. These Tartans are an integral part of our community, and are involved with athletics, the arts, student government, and so much more. Without these students, our school would not be the place that we all grew to love. TALE supports financial aid for these students, partially funding the aid packages needed for these Tartans to receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, TALE will grow so that it can sustain financial aid demand in perpetuity, ensuring that each Tartan receives an education, regardless of their financial background. What is the vision for TALE? The vision for TALE is that it becomes a self-sustaining fund that fully finances financial aid in perpetuity at St. Margaret\u2019s. In other words, the goal is for TALE to provide enough money such that that every Tartan can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of financial background. As St. Margaret\u2019s grows, the need for financial aid will grow as well. TALE can assist in alleviating these financial pressures placed on the students and St. Margaret\u2019s. Since its inception, TALE has raised over $1 million in permanently restricted funds, with a lifetime return of 8.2%. All gains have been reinvested in the fund for compounding growth to support future Tartans. Yet, TALE will need to keep growing in order to support our students. Consequently, our long-term vision is to grow TALE to ~$50 million over the next decade. TALE works like the majority of endowment funds used by educational institutions. When you donate to TALE, your dollar is invested in a collection of index funds and other assets that create compounding, long-term growth which ultimately generate funds for financial aid in perpetuity. My company has a matching gift program, what does that mean? Many companies offer as a benefit to their employees the opportunity to \u201cmatch\u201d your charitable contribution to your chosen charity or non-profit. You can utilize a matching gift through your work to surpass the leadership donor mark of $2,500 \u2013 meaning you can contribute $1,250 annually (roughly $100/month) and your company will contribute the balance to make you a leadership donor! To see if your company has program contact your Human Resources Office or contact alumni@smes.org for assistance. Can I make my gift through stocks? Alumni can make gifts multiple ways \u2013 cash, credit card, and also through stock transfers. To do so contact alumni@smes.org for all the details on how to make your gift. Can I name St. Margaret\u2019s as a beneficiary on my 401k at work or in my estate plan? Certainly. By doing so you\u2019ll become part of the Ernest D. Sillers Legacy Society . Named after Fr. Sillers, it was established to recognize those whose commitment to St. Margaret\u2019s extends well into the future. Contact Jonathan Tufo to notify us for proper recognition. Can I volunteer to serve on the Tartan Alumni Council's Endowment Committee? Certainly! We love alumni volunteers. If you have a passion for encouraging your peers to philanthropically give back to your alma mater, this might be a great volunteer fit for you! Please contact alumni@smes.org to express your interest. Do you take Venmo? Yes! Make your gift easy and just Venmo us @TartanAlumni.

Click Here to Register! Register now! The St. Margaret\u2019s Summer Institute will return on June 13-14, 2025 at St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School in beautiful San Juan Capistrano, California. This summer, we are inviting educators from all grade levels\u2014preschool through high school\u2014to join us for a transformative, hands-on professional development experience grounded in constructivist theory, place-based learning, and transdisciplinary approaches. While set in the beautiful coastal environment of California, the learning is designed to transcend location, allowing teachers to bring these powerful principles back to their classrooms no matter where they teach. On Friday, June 13, choose from one of three immersive workshops, each rooted in the idea that students learn best by doing, reflecting, and connecting their learning to the world around them. Each workshop is designed to foster active, inquiry-based, and student-centered learning that aligns with constructivist theory\u2014where knowledge is built through experiences and active engagement. The workshops include: Into the Blue: Embracing Challenge and Self-Discovery Through Ocean-Based Learning: In this immersive workshop, you'll explore the transformative power of risk, challenge, and reflection, using the ocean as a dynamic classroom. Together we will engage in hands-on activities like wave science and reflection through journaling and photography. You will read memoirs blending surfing, struggle, and self-discovery, deepening your understanding of how personal narrative and place-based learning intersect. This workshop models a student-centered approach that connects heart, mind, and body. Oceans of Wonder: Perception, Place, and the Natural World: Explore the natural world through both scientific inquiry and artistic expression. By immersing yourself in the local ecosystem, you'll discover how to help your students develop a deep connection to their environment and encourage them to observe, question, and reflect on the world around them. This workshop blends scientific inquiry (biology, ecology, environmental science) and art (sketching, journaling, photography) to promote holistic, hands-on learning\u2014an essential component of constructivism. Waves of Belonging: Surfing, Subjectivity, and Stories: This workshop will take you into the heart of California's surf culture, where you'll explore how identity, community, and personal stories shape our understanding of a place. Through storytelling, history, and the cultural significance of surf culture, you\u2019ll learn how to help students reflect on their own identities while connecting to the broader world through place-based learning. This is an example of how constructivist learning helps students create personal meaning and understanding through experience and reflection. On Saturday, June 14 we will gather for a keynote speaker, a day of reflection and application with fellow educators to discuss your experiences and explore how to bring these constructivist, place-based, and transdisciplinary learning strategies into your own classroom. The day will finish with a panel session. Attendees will leave the St. Margaret\u2019s Summer Institute with practical tools, strategies, and a fresh perspective on how to create meaningful, student-centered learning environments that encourage inquiry, reflection, and connection to the world. Whether you\u2019re teaching in California or anywhere else, you\u2019ll be ready to inspire your students with new approaches to learning that nurture curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. 2024 Recap St. Margaret's played host to early childhood educators, administrators and policy makers at the inaugural 2024 Summer Institute.

Through experiences in the visual arts, music, dance, theater and technical arts, students discover and nurture the artists within. As students from Early Childhood School through Upper School are introduced to the fundamentals of the art forms, they learn how to learn. An arts education at St. Margaret's develops 21st Century Learning Skills, supports all core subjects, creates empathy, builds bridges and helps develop voice and vision. The arts are thriving at St. Margaret's. Through many artistic endeavors, students celebrate their own work and the work of their peers and their artistic experiences connect them to generations of artists and audiences. The transforming power of the arts is vividly experienced as students explore their talents as playwrights, directors, actors, technical crew members, costume and make up designers, graphic designers, filmmakers, studio artists, photographers, choreographers, composers, literary artists and more. As the artists' skills increase through practice, they become comfortable in viewing their - and others' - work in the arts as a journey, not as a destination. The St. Margaret's arts faculty consists of dedicated professional arts educators, all of whom maintain an active professional life in the arts in addition to their work with our students.

TALE ensures that all current and future Tartans needing financial support can have the gift of a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, the goal is to grow TALE to the point that every Tartan\u2019s demonstrated need is perpetually met. Give to TALE Alumni Giving FAQ List of 8 frequently asked questions. What is TALE? TALE supports St. Margaret\u2019s Financial Aid program for current and future Tartans. It is the only endowment fund at St. Margaret\u2019s that is both driven by alumni and solely focused on helping fund financial aid. Ultimately, the goal is to have TALE serve as St. Margaret\u2019s primary source of financial aid funding, ensuring that all students can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of their financial background. How much each alumnus contributes is a personal decision. Alumni have historically given $1 to $5,000. However, each gift makes a difference, regardless of its size, and every generation of Tartan will benefit from your generosity. Who benefits from TALE? St. Margaret\u2019s provides financial aid to more than 150 Tartans each year, totaling ~$5 million. These Tartans are an integral part of our community, and are involved with athletics, the arts, student government, and so much more. Without these students, our school would not be the place that we all grew to love. TALE supports financial aid for these students, partially funding the aid packages needed for these Tartans to receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, TALE will grow so that it can sustain financial aid demand in perpetuity, ensuring that each Tartan receives an education, regardless of their financial background. What is the vision for TALE? The vision for TALE is that it becomes a self-sustaining fund that fully finances financial aid in perpetuity at St. Margaret\u2019s. In other words, the goal is for TALE to provide enough money such that that every Tartan can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of financial background. As St. Margaret\u2019s grows, the need for financial aid will grow as well. TALE can assist in alleviating these financial pressures placed on the students and St. Margaret\u2019s. Since its inception, TALE has raised over $1 million in permanently restricted funds, with a lifetime return of 8.2%. All gains have been reinvested in the fund for compounding growth to support future Tartans. Yet, TALE will need to keep growing in order to support our students. Consequently, our long-term vision is to grow TALE to ~$50 million over the next decade. TALE works like the majority of endowment funds used by educational institutions. When you donate to TALE, your dollar is invested in a collection of index funds and other assets that create compounding, long-term growth which ultimately generate funds for financial aid in perpetuity. My company has a matching gift program, what does that mean? Many companies offer as a benefit to their employees the opportunity to \u201cmatch\u201d your charitable contribution to your chosen charity or non-profit. You can utilize a matching gift through your work to surpass the leadership donor mark of $2,500 \u2013 meaning you can contribute $1,250 annually (roughly $100/month) and your company will contribute the balance to make you a leadership donor! To see if your company has program contact your Human Resources Office or contact alumni@smes.org for assistance. Can I make my gift through stocks? Alumni can make gifts multiple ways \u2013 cash, credit card, and also through stock transfers. To do so contact alumni@smes.org for all the details on how to make your gift. Can I name St. Margaret\u2019s as a beneficiary on my 401k at work or in my estate plan? Certainly. By doing so you\u2019ll become part of the Ernest D. Sillers Legacy Society . Named after Fr. Sillers, it was established to recognize those whose commitment to St. Margaret\u2019s extends well into the future. Contact Jonathan Tufo to notify us for proper recognition. Can I volunteer to serve on the Tartan Alumni Council's Endowment Committee? Certainly! We love alumni volunteers. If you have a passion for encouraging your peers to philanthropically give back to your alma mater, this might be a great volunteer fit for you! Please contact alumni@smes.org to express your interest. Do you take Venmo? Yes! Make your gift easy and just Venmo us @TartanAlumni.

These gifts require planning and, often, help from your professional advisors. Unlike cash donations, these gifts are typically made from assets in your estate rather than disposable income. There are myriad vehicles through which you can make a planned gift. When choosing a vehicle to make a gift, we ask that you consider your financial goals. There are gifts that help you protect your assets, gifts that generate income for you, and gifts that are very simple and only require a provision in your will or trust. Whether you are in your mid 30s and in the building stage of your life, or nearing retirement and considering your legacy, there is a planned gift that suits your needs and can help you meet your goals. The most common planned gifts include bequests, life insurance, trusts and annuities, retirement and pension plans, charitable IRA rollovers, and real estate. We welcome your questions and the opportunity to help you secure your family\u2019s future while making an investment in the future of St. Margaret\u2019s. Please consult with your attorney or our Director of Advancement to ensure that your bequest best achieves your desired result.

Episcopal schools are not solely communities for Christians, rather as ecumenical and diverse ministries of educational and human formation for people of all faiths and backgrounds. Episcopal schools also integrate religious and spiritual formation into the curriculum and life of the school community. Episcopal schools exist not merely to educate, but to demonstrate and proclaim the unique worth and beauty of all human beings. Chapel at St. Margaret's Led by St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School chaplains, Chapel is an integral part of the student experience for every student, nurturing character, grace, community fellowship and spiritual wellness. Every student participates in Chapel services weekly as a dedicated time in the school schedule for proclamation, celebration, solace and reflection of God\u2019s goodness and unconditional love. Chapel services and the Church campus, including the Fountain Courtyard, meditation labyrinth and garden, are sacred and safe spaces always open to students and members of the St. Margaret\u2019s community. Chapel also reinforces the sacred in ourselves and everything around us, and encourages taking time to pause, reflect and appreciate personal truth and life\u2019s authentic joys. It develops mindfulness and a deeper connection with individual spirituality and respect and care for others. The student body and professional community of each division gather as a community for Chapel as a part of the weekly schedule\u2014Early Childhood School gathers weekly, Lower School begins Monday through Thursday with Chapel, Middle School gathers twice a week and Upper School once a week. Readings, prayers and homilies are thoughtfully selected and developed by the chaplains to reflect life and the multiple faiths within the school community. Students have leadership opportunities to serve as acolytes or readers, and offer a homily that reflects upon the reading, and musical or dance performances. Through the tradition of Chapel, students also learn and practice the proper respect and decorum of a sacred space and learn to appreciate its place and value in their lives.

Congratulations to the class of 2025! I\u2019m so incredibly proud of you. In reflecting on all the things I could share with you today, I landed on what I think is the most important advice given the context of the era in which you are coming of age. You are entering a world with unprecedented access to information and thanks to artificial intelligence, many of the tasks that have been highly labor intensive throughout human history, can be done with ease \u2013 a simple set of keystrokes. Yet in this age of efficiency, I want to talk to you about something unexpected: IKEA. Yes, IKEA\u2014the big blue and yellow building you pass on the 405, famous for Swedish meatballs and flat-pack furniture. What makes IKEA unique isn\u2019t just its meatballs or minimalist design; it\u2019s that nearly everything you buy requires assembly. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve often dreaded the hours spent deciphering instructions and fumbling with allen wrenches. But every time I finish building a piece, I feel a surge of pride and satisfaction. For a long time, I thought this was just me\u2014some strange enjoyment of unnecessary challenge. But it turns out, psychologists have a name for it: it\u2019s called the IKEA Effect. And the reason I think it is so important to share is because it points to something very relevant to your lives \u2013 the direct relationship between labor and love. There is a mountain of building research that points to the centrality of hard work to people\u2019s well-being or satisfaction with life \u2013 something I never tire of contemplating. When I think about our work as a school and what we hope for you going forward, we want you all to thrive. And while that will look different for each one of you, there are some elements that will be the same. We know that strong and meaningful relationships are the key to satisfaction in life and to longevity. To live well, one needs strong relationships with people who need and want us around. And to feel good and have a high sense of well-being, we need to labor in some way. As I think about the technological advances of today and the breathtaking simplicity and efficiency of AI, I worry that we might forget that actually doing the work makes us feel useful and well. The IKEA effect tells us there is a relationship between effort and liking which has deep implications for the world of school and work. When we invest more time, effort and energy into something, we tend to value it more highly. In short, we value what we create. So you may be wondering, why am I sharing this with you now? Mainly because you will have to make choices that none of the adults in your life had to make when they were your age. So, how do you know when to embrace efficiency and when to lean into hard work? When do you take advantage of the remarkable utility of tools like AI, because you should use them \u2013 but not always. So let me offer you a few guiding principles or rules of thumb\u2014heuristics, as the AP Psychology students would say: Guiding Principle #1 \u2013 If it feels important, put time into it: Of course, many of us remember new technology entering our world and changing everything, but you have more technology, more opportunities to be highly efficient and limit workload than any of us before you. I happened to be in college during the development of email. In fact, it was so new that we didn\u2019t even call it email, we called it blitz mail \u2013 probably because it was so fast. And while it made my life endlessly easier than sending letters by mail, I always wrote the important ones to dear friends and family members by hand. To this day, receiving a handwritten note has a deeper and more profound impact on me and writing one to others feels weightier \u2013 more personal and intentional. And so that is the first lesson, if it feels important, put time into it. Guiding Principle #2 , if you think it will pay off later, work hard at it now: Probably the easiest way to think about this is in the realm of athletics or the arts. No one wakes up and easily runs a marathon and no one can effortlessly play the piano the first time they sit down. And, those early workouts and the lessons, they are sometimes quite painful. But harnessing the discipline to keep at it and work hard helps you move forward. One day you will get to a place and you won\u2019t believe the progress you have made \u2013 never shortchange the deliberate practice required to master something, even when at first it\u2019s hard. Also remember, things that at first appear to be less useful could become so in the future. I don\u2019t think we would have the beauty and simplicity of Apple products if Steve Jobs did not put effort into his calligraphy lessons. You just never know when you need access to a skill. Guiding Principle #3 , if it sparks joy and engagement, lean into it: I\u2019m certain that many of you know what you like and what you don\u2019t like. Some of you have declared majors and have a plan for the path ahead. And while that is wonderful, make sure to hold space for what I call glimmers. These are moments of joy and engagement that occur, sometimes in the strangest of contexts and definitely not according to plan. After college and after what was a very challenging first year of work, I landed what I thought was a dream job. I took a job in an admission office in an independent school in South Florida and I was the Spanish speaking Admission officer. That allowed me to travel all over Central and South American and the Caribbean meeting with families who wanted to send students to our boarding school. I was being paid to travel and use my Spanish \u2013 a true dream. But what surprised me was that the glimmers were not on planes and hotels in Guatemala, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. They were when I was on the ground at school, working with individual students as an advisor and analyzing data on spreadsheets \u2013 I barely recognized myself. But I\u2019m so grateful I didn\u2019t dismiss these glimmers, because they all led me to you, and there is no other place I would rather be. When you look at each other today you know that you are all talented, incredibly capable and looking toward bright futures. And while this is true for all of you, there is one thing that only you, no one else, has. As said by Anna Quindlen, \u201cyou are the one person alive who has sole custody of your life. Your particular life. Your entire life. Not just the life of your mind, but the life of your heart. Not just you bank account, but your soul.\u201d And ultimately, you are the only one who can determine what is most important to the development of your heart, mind and soul. And as Oprah Winfrey once said, \u201cunderstand the right to choose your own path is a sacred privilege. Use it. Dwell in possibility.\u201d So put in the time, do the work \u2013 find your unique path and throw yourself into it. And keep in mind, the most beautiful paths have plenty of curves and changes in elevation. Choose to work, even when it is hard, and you will fall in love with your unique path and feel like your life has purpose and meaning. Know that sometimes a path full of twists and turns and challenge is exactly what is required to find the life your soul is seeking. And when your path leads you to assemble a bureau or bedframe from IKEA, remember: the effort is part of the reward. Class of 2025, I am endlessly proud of you. I can\u2019t wait to see the unique paths you forge and the incredible things you will create. You are loved, you are appreciated, and it has been an honor to watch you grow through your hard work and determination.

Dear St. Margaret\u2019s Community, In the early months of the new year, so many of us aspire to make changes for the better. We look back on the year that recently closed, and we set intentions and goals to make the current year better than the one before. As we all know, making these changes can be quite challenging. At the core of this desire to change is motivation\u2014a topic I find endlessly fascinating. My first official foray into the topic of motivation was in my doctoral program when I was assigned a book called, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol Dweck. Through years of research, Dweck explained to me in one thin book how a mindset could alter one\u2019s approach to learning for better or worse. When I arrived at St. Margaret\u2019s in 2012 as the Academic Dean, Carol Dweck was the first person I invited to speak to parents and professional community members. Her description of the distinction between a fixed and a growth mindset, and the motivational behaviors they drive, was truly life changing for me. Now thanks to Dweck\u2019s original work, we have another remarkable opportunity to delve deeper into motivation through the work of David Yeager. His new book titled, 10 to 25: the Science of Motivating Young People digs deeper into how we can help the young people in our lives reach their fullest potential. Motivation is one facet of the human experience that can be incredibly awe inspiring and also remarkably frustrating. We have analyzed our own motivations and certainly questioned whether we are doing all that we can to motivate our children toward whatever aim we or they deem important. We watch our children tirelessly train for an athletic contest, spend hours reciting lines or study one topic for hours and then wonder how that same tenacity is not evident in all aspects of their lives. This book, while technically focused on a specific age range, is relevant to anyone who is on a learning path and more directly to the people who are in a position to mentor them. The original research grounding the book is based on the wise-feedback study. This landmark study defined three mindsets commonly employed to motivate young people called the enforcer, protector and mentor mindsets. In the first mindset, the enforcer, the manager focuses on the high standard and doesn\u2019t consider supporting the person to achieve that standard. In the protector mindset, the manager focuses on the potential distress of achieving a high standard and therefore lowers the expectation. In the mentor mindset, \u201cyoung people are held to high standards, but they are also given the support they need to meet those high standards.\u201d Throughout the book, Yeager shares research that makes clear the mentor mindset is the way to help young people grow and succeed. Yeager goes on to say that if you have high standards and a high level of support, you can be a mentor and help a young person achieve remarkable goals. And importantly, the mentor mindset helps us provide a route to what young people (generally ages 10-25) really crave, which is respect. He notes that young people yearn to feel accomplished and deeply desire respect from their peers, which he describes as prestige. In utilizing the mentor mindset we can help young people \u201cearn prestige which they need far more than a self-esteem puff-up. Thus we can begin to resolve the adolescent predicament.\u201d For those who are not yet reflecting on the adolescent predicament, as he calls it, it is often experienced as a conflict in what we think should be motivating to young people and what actually motivates them. For those of you who are inclined to read his book, I won\u2019t ruin the intrigue but instead tell you that it will likely help you understand the teenager in your home or the one you are about to have. What motivates any of us is the question that caused me to pick up the book and what kept me reading it and buying it for everyone on my leadership team: I truly believe it is one of the things that makes St. Margaret\u2019s so special. Mentors abound here, whether they are in the classrooms or on the fields, courts and stages. They hold young people to high expectations and provide the support they need to get there. They truly believe in our young people and that belief is communicated in word and deed. This is the reason why I consistently hear from our graduates that they are prepared for college and for life. It is because they have been treated with the dignity and respect of high expectations and high support, and they know that they can achieve their goals because they have done it before. They have earned the status and respect that comes from working hard and seeing one\u2019s goals fulfilled, all while having teachers, coaches and advisors behind and beside them. And, as it relates to peers who determine which behaviors are respected, our young people are surrounded by classmates who are hard-working and set high expectations for themselves. This can\u2019t be underestimated as a relevant factor in why and how peer respect is earned. Just recently I met a young man who is interested in joining the St. Margaret\u2019s community. He said one of the reasons for his interest is that, \u201cat SMES, I feel like I can flourish because everyone is aspiring to be their best selves. I find that incredibly motivating and I want to be a part of it.\u201d I loved his fresh-eyed insight into our student body and the power of the student culture. His perspective caused me to reflect on the difference between my high school and college experience. In college, I was surrounded by aspiring, hard-working peers who were both interested and interesting. My college peers were early to class, studied hard, went to office hours and set high expectations for themselves. I was positively influenced by my peers and reflected on this experience when choosing a school for my own children. The student culture at St. Margaret\u2019s cannot be underestimated as a factor in the learning and growth of our children. We look to our peers, particularly in adolescence, to determine what is valued and respected. I love that at St. Margaret\u2019s, it is respected to be kind, hard-working, motivated, and to give back to our communities. F or parents and adults, Yeager reminds us that the secret sauce of the mentor mindset is treating young people with dignity and respect at a time when they are most vulnerable. He goes on to say, \u201cThat\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s the human condition.\u201d And importantly, another part of the human condition is the pride one feels in real accomplishment \u2013 things that are hard-earned and supported by respected mentors and peers. As we embark on this new year together, I wish you the motivation to achieve your goals and the mindset to help the young people in your life achieve theirs. I know I speak for our entire professional community when I tell you that it is such an incredible honor to be a witness to a young person developing in heart and mind each day. We take this responsibility seriously and we are grateful for the opportunity to be your partner in the growth of your precious children.

Happy birthday St. Margaret\u2019s! As we celebrate our school\u2019s 45 th anniversary and make progress on our new heart of the campus, the St. Margaret\u2019s Commons, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on our founder, Father Sillers, and how he would feel to see our school now. Much has been written about Father Sillers and what motivated him to come out of retirement to open our school on October 1, 1979. In an interview on the topic, he said the following: \u201cWe are very happy in the work because of our great love for children. And if I can help a few children, then I feel my life\u2019s work has been very worthwhile, because children are growing up in a very difficult world today\u2026 where there are many complexities and pressures and temptations and all kinds of difficult situations for them to cope with. If we can help develop the character of these children so they have some depth and some strength and some fortitude in their interior lids to give them strength to face these problems and to cope with them, then I feel I\u2019m making a contribution to society, helping to build a better world. And that\u2019s very satisfying.\u201d The through line for our remarkable Tartan community has always been about the children. The people who choose to work here and the people who choose this place for their children are all focused on building a better world through the education of the hearts and minds of young people. We have chosen this place as our home because of what Father Sillers envisioned many years ago, and it gives me great pleasure to think about all the young Tartans who have made this place a home with the goal of going out and making a better world. The theme for this year\u2019s PTF General Membership Meetings is centered around home, which deeply resonates with me. Dr. Tania Robertson, PTF President, asked me to share my feelings around home for the opening kickoff meeting. I immediately knew that I would center my words around St. Margaret\u2019s and how this place has become my home, despite living most of my life on the east coast. I then began reflecting on how others may perceive home and my belief that many people would reference their childhoods. As I shared in the opening PTF meeting, my upbringing\u2014with many moves throughout central Massachusetts and many different schools early in my life\u2014didn\u2019t lend itself to an image of a childhood home. Yet the one constant was my immediate family. At a tender age, I learned that life would bring change\u2014much of it unwanted\u2014yet I could always count on the people who loved me. For me, home was about the people, not just a place. I share that sentiment here, as well. St. Margaret\u2019s has become my home because of the people. The people who are drawn to this place\u2014the professional community, the families who send their precious children, and the students themselves\u2014share a set of beliefs about childhood, the importance of education and how people deserve to be treated. We are all drawn to the whole child mission, the core values and the Episcopal identity that guide us to see the inherent beauty and dignity in every person. Because we have all selected this school as our place of work or as our partner in raising our children, we have so much in common. Perhaps it is this shared set of values that encourages us to be respectful and thoughtful even when we have differences of opinion. Our Upper School students exemplify these shared values and have recently had in-depth conversations about the national election and the unfolding war in the Middle East, all the while listening with empathy and respecting each other\u2019s differences. As a school, we work to teach our students not what to think but how to think and, importantly, how to listen to those with whom they may disagree. When I think about what we are seeing in the national landscape and the divisiveness that is apparent in our country, I feel hopeful when I see how our students engage across differences and use evidence to support their thinking. They are learning to lead and serve, and I believe they are the hope for our future. The best of us can listen with empathy and work to find common ground even when little is immediately apparent. I see our students leaning into the discomfort of disagreeing about ideas, but nonetheless treating each other with kindness, respect and dignity. That is not happening on all campuses, and I am incredibly grateful to our professional community for teaching our students to be prepared for the world that exists but with the express intent of leaving it a little better than they found it. The community we share is so very special. I hear all the time from new families and new professional community members how welcome they feel from the moment they walk on our campus. I hope you and your family feel like St. Margaret\u2019s is home. We are all here to support, encourage and lift each other up. And importantly, over my 20-plus years as a Tartan, I have learned that the more I give to this beloved place, the more I get in return. I encourage each of you to get involved by saying yes to events and opportunities, yes to gatherings with fellow Tartans, yes to speakers, performances and athletic events and yes to embracing all that St. Margaret\u2019s has to offer. I hope to see you all at the upcoming Parent Up Speaker Series, the Homecoming game and our beloved Forever Plaid gala, to name a few. I promise this community will give you more than you ever thought possible. It is all of you who make St. Margaret\u2019s home for me. Thank you for all you do to make this place a home where everyone belongs \u2013 a place where we are instilling in our children that they indeed have the depth, strength and fortitude to make our world a better place. Father Sillers saw this need in 1979, and it is still ever present. I feel honored to partner with you in this journey as we work to fulfill our mission of educating young hearts and minds for lives of learning, leadership and service.

This change of pace offers an opportunity to reflect on the year we recently closed and to think forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead. Walking through campus, I have found quiet moments to sit outside and listen to the laughter of young people playing on the field and to pause and appreciate the beauty of our evolving campus. I have felt a deep sense of gratitude as I reflect on our incredible Tartan community, anticipating the joy I will feel when we are all back together soon. Throughout this summer, St. Margaret\u2019s has been alive with the energy of our summer programs, from Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano to Summer at St. Margaret\u2019s to Special Camp. The love, laughter and loud cheering keeps our campus feeling active and energized. We also have a new perspective on campus now that Wallace Hall is no longer standing. From the front of our campus by my office, it is now possible to see directly into the Ortega Village Center, providing a better sense of the breadth of our physical footprint. This newfound perspective is a reminder that St. Margaret\u2019s is growing and changing and that is such a gift. This year, we will be celebrating our 45 th year as a school. It has been inspiring to look back and see the photos from our humble beginnings in 1979 compared to how our beautiful campus looks today. I am certain that our founder, The Reverend Canon Ernest Sillers, would be incredibly proud of what we have become. Our school is thriving by every metric and now we are on the precipice of constructing the much-awaited St. Margaret\u2019s Commons, a place to nourish body and spirit and the central gathering place for generations of Tartans. We have also embarked on the beginning stages of developing a new Strategic Plan and look forward to getting feedback from all of you and sharing our progress as the year unfolds. There is so much to look forward to and the excitement on campus is truly palpable. I think it is also fair to recognize that change brings a level of uncertainty and that creates a mix of human emotions: excitement, apprehension, gratitude, trust, uncertainty \u2013 truly the full range. It is important to recognize that these emotions exist whenever change is afoot and if we can recognize them, we can manage them. I have reflected on the words of one of our newest teachers in the Upper School. He told me that for the 28 years he has been an educator, he consistently wakes up each morning feeling so excited for the day. He says his mantra is, \u201cI get to do this.\u201d I love this phrase because it not only encompasses what has gone well, but it expresses appreciation for the ability to engage regardless of outcome. It is truly gratitude in action. As we move into this year where change is present in almost every area of our lives, let\u2019s together remember that \u201cwe get to do this.\u201d We get to shape the future of St. Margaret\u2019s; the place we call home and the school we love dearly. We get to continue growing and enhancing our beautiful campus by building a community space that will positively impact Tartans for generations. We get to cheer for our student-athletes, celebrate the wins and support each other through losses. We get to be inspired by our students\u2019 artistic pursuits, whether in the studio or on the stage, and recognize the importance of the arts in our understanding of the human experience. We get to chart the course for the next generation of Tartans through our upcoming strategic planning process. We get to do all of this together with love and support in a community that is diverse in background but unified in our desire to raise young people with bright minds and caring hearts. Let\u2019s do this together Tartans. I can\u2019t wait to have you all back!

Dear Families, As I am writing my third quarter letter to you, I am filled with gratitude for the state of St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. In January, at the annual State of the School Address, we shared mission-critical metrics about the achievement and well-being of our students, our positive financial trajectory and growing endowment, and the success of our Tartans Thrive Campaign to build a transformational space in the heart of our campus for all Tartans. The quantitative and qualitative inputs that we track point to an incredibly healthy and vibrant school. A school that is truly thriving. With record-level admission applications across all grade levels this year, I\u2019m thrilled to share today that we are enjoying the highest levels of re-enrollment in school history. Attrition at St. Margaret\u2019s is lower than ever which is especially meaningful during a time when schools around the nation are seeing trends in the opposite direction. And we look forward to welcoming a group of incredibly qualified new students in all divisions this fall. Thank you for your partnership and support in affirming the school culture we have established for our students at St. Margaret\u2019s\u2014one of courage, optimism, respect, hard work, ambition, positivity, support, friendship, and love. I believe the culture of a community is central to the ways in which people in that community think and behave. A healthy culture is additive, wherein each potential is realized or exceeded. The sense of love and support we all feel as a community enables us to stretch and take calculated risks. For our children to thrive, they need the freedom to grow within a loving and nurturing environment. With this solid foundation from which to develop, our children can try new things, make new friends, and consider opportunities that before may have seemed out of reach. For example, I love that we have a student who picked up football in his senior year and will now be playing at the college level. Another student, a junior, arrived at St. Margaret\u2019s as a sophomore and fell in love with our Peer Counseling program and wanted to share that love with everyone. She endeavored to create a monthly newsletter for all Upper School Tartans to share insight into health and well-being tips and updates. We are now all benefiting from this tremendous resource. I have experienced several school cultures in my years as an educator, and St. Margaret\u2019s is a \u201c yes and \u201d culture. Our school is a place where students and adults say yes to new challenges, yes to new opportunities, yes to working both hard and smart, yes to supporting their classmates \u2013 yes, and\u2026 whatever leads us toward greater levels of growth. The environment instills confidence in our students and allows our young Tartans to push themselves to their highest potential while feeling the respect, love and encouragement of their teachers, coaches, and peers. Recent PTF Parent Up Speaker Shawn Achor, in his most recent book, Big Potential , shares research that reveals that success and happiness \u201c depend almost entirely on how well we connect with, relate to, and learn from one another.\u201d To be our best selves and to reach our highest potential, we need to be in community with one another. We need to rely on each other and help each other grow and thrive. Mr. Achor\u2019s words remind me of Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s book, Outliers , that describes unique ecosystems that lead to high levels of excellence. Mr. Gladwell states, \u201cThe values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.\u201d The world of our students consists primarily of their homes and St. Margaret\u2019s, and we shape the world they inhabit. It is all of us and our shared values that create our culture. Recently there has been great interest in social science and how one\u2019s environment impacts decision making and behavior. A book I read recently called The Peer Effect: How Your Peers Shape Who You Are and Who You Will Become by Syed Ali and Margaret Chin addresses this topic profoundly. The authors look at peer culture through the lens of their own high school which is well known for its academic achievement. Ali and Chin make the following claim: \u201c When people ask why teens behave the way they do, culture is the answer. Their behavior is not about age or hormones, but about how teens are organized within peer groups and the norms those groups uphold.\u201d They go on to say, \u201cwho you hang out with affects who you are and who you will become.\u201d To me, the operative clause in this sentence is \u201c who you will become .\u201d For many of us, we spend so many days and years at St. Margaret\u2019s it would be understandable if we sometimes overlook the uniqueness of our culture. I want you to know that I never fail to see it and I vow to grow and develop this beautiful environment that leads everyone to become their very best self. Each person in this community plays a part in St. Margaret\u2019s success, because everyone contributes to the culture of our school. I am incredibly grateful for this place we call home and all the people who make up that home \u2013 you, our amazing Tartan community. Thank you for sharing your precious children with us each day. They are a true gift, and we will never take this gift for granted. I think a lot about the long-term impact of a St. Margaret\u2019s education as it relates to our mission to educate hearts and minds for lives of learning, leading and serving. These early years at St. Margaret\u2019s are pivotal and long lasting for our students and we have a responsibility to do all we can to help them develop the tools they need to grow into young adults who will become the very best they can be - because someday in the not too distant future they will be the generation of educators, leaders, volunteers and philanthropists who will change the world for the better, one Tartan at a time!

Dear St. Margaret\u2019s Families, I am overwhelmed with gratitude by the love and support I felt at yesterday\u2019s event. It is an incredible honor to be installed as St. Margaret\u2019s fifth head of school by Bishop Taylor, and to have the clergy, the entire student body, the professional community, my family and lifelong friends, current and former trustees, parents, alumni, parents of alumni, grandparents and so many community leaders there to support this transition in our school\u2019s history. It is profoundly impactful. To you, our current families, thank you for your partnership and the trust you place in us every day with your children. These young Tartans are the true essence of hope and goodness in the world. As many of you have heard me say, one of the numerous reasons I chose St. Margaret\u2019s almost two decades ago was because of the positive student culture. I could see it in the way students interacted with each other and the adults on campus. There is a culture of gratitude that is strong on this campus, and I see it everywhere I turn. When I first started teaching at St. Margaret\u2019s, I experienced something so simple, yet so telling, about the culture of this school. After my first class, the students began filing out and every one of them thanked me. Although I had worked in schools for most of my life, I had never experienced students thanking me after class. I was so curious about this behavior that I asked the teacher next door why they thanked me. She was a longstanding teacher at St. Margaret\u2019s with over 20 years of experience and she looked at me with a puzzled expression. She said, \u201cThey thanked you for the lesson. They always do and they always will.\u201d She was right\u2014for the entirety of the eight years I taught AP psychology, my students thanked me after every lesson. This is not something that is taught or mandated, it is what they do \u2013 it is the culture of gratitude that is abundant on our campus. I could truly write for days about examples of gratitude and kindness I see daily, but I want you to know why it is so important and why it is so critical to our mission of educating both hearts and minds of our young people for lives of learning, leadership, and service. Gratitude, as it turns out, is not just a wonderful feeling. It is an essential component of human well-being. In his landmark book Flourish , Dr. Martin Seligman, former President of the American Psychological Association and founder of the field of positive psychology, cites research on the power of sharing and recording gratitude. It is one element of a burgeoning body of research that continues to shape the science of human thriving. Scientific research in psychology has traditionally been geared toward healing suffering, a critical and laudable pursuit, yet incomplete when considering the totality of the human condition and the pursuit of optimal well-being. According to Seligman, \u201cIf positive psychology aims to build well-being on the planet, well-being must be buildable.\u201d He continues by writing, \u201cfor sound evolutionary reasons, most of us are not nearly as good at dwelling on good events as we are at analyzing bad events. So, to overcome our brains\u2019 natural catastrophic bent, we need to work on and practice this skill of thinking about what went well.\u201d His advice is to spend time each night writing down three to five things that went well and make that a practice. What Seligman has found is that students will often report that this simple practice has profound effects that many report as life changing. In their early research on recording gratitude, Dr. Robert Emmons and Dr. Michael McCullough found that those people who kept a gratitude journal and recorded their feelings of gratitude, as compared to other experimental conditions, exercised more frequently, reported better physical health, felt better about their lives as a whole and were more optimistic about the week ahead . In his research on the impact of gratitude at work, Dr. Emmons writes, \u201c\u2026you literally cannot overplay the hand of gratitude; the grateful mind reaps massive benefits in every domain of life that has been examined.\u201d I have shared this research with my students over the years and with the St. Margaret\u2019s professional community. At the beginning of this year, our professional community in-service day in September was led by our Director of Institutional Research Dr. Stephanie Capen and focused on those elements that lead to human thriving and a reflective gratitude experience. It was powerful to sit with other members of our professional community in Chapel and to think deeply about the people and experiences for which we are grateful. I also had the opportunity to share this practice with the Lower and Middle School students in recent homilies. For our youngest children, gratitude is a complex word, so we discussed it differently. I explained to them that when my own children were small, part of our bedtime routine was an exercise called \u201cthree happies.\u201d Each night we would choose three things for which we were grateful and share them with each other at bedtime. I offered this practice to our Lower School students and have been so touched by the many students who have been excited to share their three happies with me when I see them arrive to school in the morning. It is a joy and an honor to lead our remarkable school and to build on the great work accomplished before me by the four previous Heads of School, our founder The Reverend Canon Ernest Sillers, Mark Campaigne, Marc Hurlbut and Will Moseley. In this moment of Thanksgiving, I hope you all know how enormously thankful I am for your love and support. I am grateful beyond measure.

Dear St. Margaret\u2019s Families, One of the great joys of being an adult in a school community is the opportunity to learn each day. We learn from our students, each other, our parents, the church and from experts we invite to our community. This year our professional community experienced a learning opportunity that continues to energize me and has been a source of both reflection and joy. I am excited to offer my first quarterly parent message on the work that we began before school started which continues to invigorate us every day. My message to you is an invitation\u2014to better understand something happening at school, to join us for an event, or to reflect on the power of our learning community. And because at my core I am an educator, I will often share research that has guided my thinking. Whether you are an Early, Lower, Middle or Upper School parent, it is my hope that my invitation to you feels relevant and meaningful. Each year in the Opening Days, as we refer to them, our professional community has the opportunity to learn together before students arrive in our classrooms. As we reflected on the many remarkable attributes of St. Margaret\u2019s, we decided to spotlight the wonderful sense of community that is a core value and a distinctive aspect of our culture that we all hold dear. We invited Charles Vogl, author of The Art of Community and St. Margaret\u2019s alumnus class of 1992, to join us for a day of learning and reflection. He began his time with us by defining the word community as \u201ca group of individuals who share a mutual concern for one another\u2019s welfare.\u201d He juxtaposes this definition with groups of people who may have shared interests, like support of a sports team, museums or medical associations, yet are unaware of each other\u2019s existence. In a community as defined by Vogl, the ties are to each other. He went on to further explain how we can explicitly build community by extending real and meaningful invitations. In small groups he had us all explore a time when we were invited to an event or an experience and how that made us feel. In the room that day, there were tears, laughter and embraces. For many people in the room, they harkened back to middle school or high school when the power of an invitation transformed their feelings of community. This same exercise was played out with student leadership groups in the Upper School and the experience was equally astounding. I was part of a small group where a new student shared that simply being invited to join a small discussion group by an older student was a powerful feeling of belonging. As a young person, I moved around quite a bit and each time my family moved I found myself in a new public school. The desire for community has lived in me throughout my life, perhaps because I struggled to find it as a young person. Part of the great joy of discovering St. Margaret\u2019s almost 20 years ago was the prospect of being rooted in a community that valued this wonderful sense of belonging. As I look back on my years as a member of this community, I am so grateful to have been present for events both large and small. My only regret is that I missed any at all. I sit in Lower School Chapel now and wish I had been there more frequently as a parent, as I now see that the red sweater days are both magical and fleeting. When I attended the reunion for the first five classes of Tartan graduates, I was struck by their experience of community and the power of their relationships, decades after they graduated. These relationships are the key to well-being as we now understand from landmark research done at Harvard, which followed a group of participants for over 75 years. In their book, The Good Life: Lessons from the World\u2019s Longest Scientific Study on Happiness , Robert Waldinger and Marc Shultz shine a brilliant light on the importance of relationships and their ability to sustain us and ultimately make our lives more meaningful, richer and longer. I want to invite you to the many events that will be happening over the next few weeks. The opportunities to be together as a community are powerful reminders of all that we share. The PTF Tartan Family BBQ next Friday, Oct. 13 has become so popular that we have moved it to Chalmers Field. We look forward to our Tartans enjoying this great space to play before they head to the Homecoming football game that night. The PTF will also be hosting a General Membership Meeting on October 19 that is an opportunity to hear updates on the school. We hope you will join us for the annual Forever Plaid gala hosted by the PTF on November 4 at VEA Newport Beach. On campus, the arts will be showcasing the Upper School play Frankenstein October 26-28, The Frightfest Arts Showcase on Oct. 30, and SpongeBob the Musical in the Middle School on November 16-18. In the realm of athletics, the many exciting contests are posted on mySMES and at www.smes.org/athletics . If you have been a part of this community for many years, please consider reaching out to a new family and inviting them to join you at a community event. They may never forget this small act of kindness. The opportunity for you and your children to develop lifelong and meaningful relationships in this beautiful community is incredibly precious. I invite you to join us for events big and small and look very forward to seeing you all soon.

Vision Statement St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School is a diverse community dedicated to developing the whole child. We nurture spiritual growth, an appreciation for life-long learning, the courage to lead and a responsibility to give to others. Our graduates are independent thinkers of integrity and compassion who reveal their resilience and collaborative nature in the face of challenge and opportunity. Core Values List of 5 items. Character We emphasize integrity, spirituality, empathy, perseverance and responsibility. Community We champion mutual respect, engagement, collaboration, service learning and a commitment to the common good. Balance and Breadth We believe personal growth, balance and well-being are fostered through a broad range of academic, artistic, athletic and co-curricular opportunities. Equity and Inclusion We embrace and celebrate the identity of every human being, and advocate for equity, inclusion and justice. High Expectations We prepare and empower our students to discover and develop their unique gifts and talents to achieve their full potential. St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs. Episcopal Identity St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School is upheld by the basic principles of our Episcopal tenets that individuals and institutions are called to strive for justice and peace among all people, and to respect the dignity of every human being. Episcopal schools are not solely communities for Christians, rather as ecumenical and diverse ministries of educational and human formation for people of all faiths and backgrounds. Episcopal schools also integrate religious and spiritual formation into the curriculum and life of the school community. Episcopal schools exist not merely to educate, but to demonstrate and proclaim the unique worth and beauty of all human beings. As an Episcopal School we uphold our Statement of Faith in carrying out the important work of our mission. Our tradition appreciates the mystery and breadth of God\u2019s love and inspires debate, welcomes diverse ideas, values ambiguity and paradox, and respects traditions other than those set out in the Book of Common Prayer, the basis for corporate worship in the Episcopal Church. We affirm the right of each child and each member of our community to follow spiritual paths free from coercion\u2014paths open to discussion and inquiry that are respectful of the Episcopal tradition and of differing views. From Early Childhood School through Upper School, opportunities for spiritual learning, worship, prayer, reflection, and participation in the Eucharist are offered and comprise a foundation for all students to recognize the importance of their own spirituality and the critical value of acceptance and understanding among people of different faiths. The vision of our founding headmaster, The Reverend Canon Ernest D. Sillers, continues to guide us today, \u201cEvery student is a sacred and precious child of God, endowed with the potential to become a productive, contributing member of society. Our purpose is to prepare students for life in a complex society, beset with grave problems and great pressures, by providing a strong program in character development and teaching morals undergirded with basic Judeo-Christian values.\u201d We seek to prepare future leaders of conviction and perspective who can appreciate the powerful, positive role that inclusivity and understanding can have on the future direction of human kind. We expect our students to strive for justice and peace among all peoples, and respect the dignity of every human being.* As a result, we expect our students to be contributing members of our school community and the world beyond. From the Baptismal Covenant of the Book of Common Prayer* We are fortunate to be identified as an Episcopal school, not only because this expresses the importance and centrality of God\u2019s grace, love and power in the raising of children, but also because this tradition provides a compass for our navigation through the shifting winds of change so prevalent in our lives today. We strive to act out of love, to teach love, to model love and to love one another in this community. As an Episcopal School, we will always consider God in reviewing our mission and maintaining our course. 26 We realize that some of our graduates may encounter times of uncertainty of their faith and lacking absolute clarity in their lives. In these instances, have we failed them? Our answer is no. We believe that the grounding they acquire here in study, reflection, debate and conscious pursuit of spirituality will serve as an enduring guide and offer consolation in times of doubt and confusion. Our job is to plant seeds that, with God\u2019s help, will flourish in time. To read about our student Chapel program, please click here .

Our mission, core values, and DEI work are rooted in our Episcopal identity, which calls us to seek God in and honor the dignity of every human being. Our Equity and Inclusion core value compels us: We embrace and celebrate the identity of every human being, and advocate for equity, inclusion, and justice. We aim to create an environment at St. Margaret\u2019s where every Tartan is known and loved for who they are and who they are fully. Fostering that environment requires continued strategic planning, captured through our innovation strategy, accreditation focus areas, and yearly DEI priorities. List of 3 items. What do we mean by Diversity? We recognize and celebrate that diversity exists in the backgrounds and experiences that have shaped our lives. Diversity encompasses the complexity of the human experience: our life experiences, our journeys through the world, the faiths we observe, the traditions we practice, the structures of our families, our socioeconomic statuses, the languages we speak, the colors of our skin, our abilities, our physical, social, emotional, and spiritual needs, and the list goes on. These myriad intersecting identities shape us as individuals, in groups, and in our school community. At St. Margaret\u2019s, we are proud that our Tartans\u2019 many backgrounds, life experiences, and identities weave together to form a wonderful fabric that unites us and prepares our students for living in a complex global society. What do we mean by Inclusion? By inclusion, we mean our ability to honor and respect the dignity of every human being. Inclusion means that when Tartans walk onto campus, they can bring their full selves each and every day. Each of our backgrounds, perspectives, and social identifiers belong here\u2014fully and without exception. I am my full self. I belong. When we engage in inclusion work, we ask ourselves, \u201cIs every member of our community able to co-create the culture of our school? Whose voices and experiences are included? Whose are not?\u201d \u201cBeing seen, valued and loved for who you are by nurturing adults and peers is the rich soil in which a young person flourishes and thrives. We have a wonderfully diverse community of people who come from many cultures, backgrounds and experiences. We want every Tartan to feel they belong here. At its most fundamental level, DEI work is love work. It is about ensuring that every member of our community is known and experiences a sense of belonging,\u201d says Director of Equity and Inclusion Victor Cota. What do we mean by Equity? Whenever and wherever we find that certain voices and experiences are less represented than others, that is when our equity work kicks in. We understand that ours is a world of imbalanced access to opportunities and resources. As a result, people in the same community will have very different experiences. When we engage in equity work, we ask ourselves, \u201cWho is favored? Who is not? Who has privilege in this situation? Who does not?\u201d Then, as we become more comfortable and informed, we ask, \u201cWhat will we do about it?\u201d Sometimes this means reflecting on individual behaviors and sometimes it means examining entire systems. What matters is that we recognize that inequity exists, work to identify it, and ask the questions to fully understand it, move through any subsequent discomfort, and act. At St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School, we are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. List of 1 members.

College is an essential next step for almost all of our graduates, though our mission is focused more broadly on nurturing children to develop, succeed and thrive in life, today and tomorrow. Rooted in a strong foundation of educational expertise, research, leading pedagogy and best practice, St. Margaret\u2019s vigorous liberal arts academic program is the core roadmap of our students\u2019 growth and maturation to adulthood. It is developmentally appropriate and coordinated from early childhood to high school graduation. The breadth and depth of the academic program provides student choice and relevance that cultivate personal meaning and voice. Opportunities for exploration, discovery, service and leadership abound in STEAM, experiential and interdisciplinary learning, arts and athletics engage and nurture every child at every age in their unique talents. The program is vigorous, inspiring students to set high aspirations, work at the highest levels and achieve their full potential. We are proud of the exceptional quality and expertise of our educators, whom we attract from across the nation. Our professional community is committed to excellence in education and continue to hone their craft as professionals. A passion for student learning and growth motivates our educators, and they are deeply invested in their students' growth and well-being. St. Margaret\u2019s expert faculty members foster authentic engagement and enduring understandings based on inquiry, critical thinking, in-depth analysis, creative thinking and problem solving. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of measurement with a focus on mastery learning, yet we recognize that not all students learn at the same pace and in the same way. Our experienced educators use formative and summative data to inform their teaching practices in the classroom to support every student. A hallmark of a St. Margaret\u2019s education is the many faculty members who are engaged and involved in the life of each student. Students are supported by a professional community of teachers, advisors, college counselors, chaplains and coaches. Our class sizes are small so every teacher knows and loves every student and differentiates instruction accordingly. Further, the mission of educating hearts and minds requires St. Margaret\u2019s to understand the motivational and affective components of passion, interest, relevance and meaning in the learning process. Through an appreciation of diversity, the interconnectedness of the human experience, and real global and environmental challenges, students experience learning in a dynamic, resource-rich environment where problems are complex and answers are ambiguous and they are nurtured and empowered to make claims and find solutions. We are developing learners of the future, with the capacity to lead, the humility to serve, the passion to pursue interests, the strength to overcome challenges, and the will to make the world a better place.

As a subject area specialist, the chair leads the department in curricular reviews to vertically and horizontally align curriculum in grades 4 through 12. Department chairs are responsible for developing new courses and staying on the leading edge of content and pedagogy within the discipline. As lead teachers, department chairs guide department faculty in department goals, planning, and discussions, and provide professional development opportunities that reflect promising practices in instruction within each discipline. All student assessment data, both local and nationally normed, is reviewed by the department chairs in an effort to ameliorate weaknesses and celebrate strengths. Decisions about acceleration, typically in the form of honors and Advanced Placement courses, are made by department chairs. List of 10 items. Computer Science The St. Margaret\u2019s community is empowered by emerging technologies without boundaries, transcending traditional approaches to teaching and learning. Using the design thinking model, we promote experiential, collaborative and creative learning in order to demystify the complexities often associated with technology.

Purposeful integration of STEM subjects to enable cross-curricular learning for deeper understanding of subject matter. Demonstrate persistence in working with complex problems. English The English Department seeks to develop in each student the ability to write clear and persuasive prose, the skills required to read and interpret literature, and the power to make full use of written and spoken language. We are consistent in our use of the process approach to writing. We help students put their written work through a thoughtful and often time-consuming process of drafting and revision. Through repeated emphasis on critical thinking and writing, students encounter both themselves and differing voices in small group environments that encourage discussion. Through the study of literature, students experience diversity in voice and develop empathy for the alternative narratives of the human experience. In the end, the study of literature invites the ongoing questions: who am I in the world, and what does it mean to be human? The English Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Master the processes of reading, writing, and speaking Analyze texts, interpret, and read for subtexts, hidden meanings, and paradoxes Develop the art of communication and personal expression Read actively and connect to previous knowledge and experience Understand one\u2019s own process of learning Empathize with the stories of others and alternative narratives of human expression Discover and develop insight and personal identity through literature Think critically History & Social Science The History Department believes that knowledge of the past is necessary to comprehend the present and to forge the future thoughtfully and deliberately. We foster the sheer enjoyment of the adventure of historical discovery and study, seeing ourselves in the present as interconnected with people of the past \u2013 our families, fellow citizens and humanity around the globe. Through the study of history, students will learn foundational content, think carefully and precisely, interpret bias, and articulate thinking in oral and written form. Research of primary documents will foster critical readers who are able to analyze and synthesize data in order to develop and prove a thesis. Small discussion groups and writing workshops help our students to develop an awareness of oneself with the ability to respect, understand, and appreciate differences.

While we value the mastery of skills and computational techniques, we stress the understanding of concepts and the significance of results. Our instructors create a supportive learning community that encourages collaboration both in and out of the classroom.

Through experiences in Dance, Music, and Theater, students discover and nurture the artist within. As students are introduced to the fundamentals of an art form, they learn how to learn. As their skill increases through practice, they become comfortable viewing their own work - as well as the work of others - as a journey, not a destination. We believe that the power of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As members of ensembles, students celebrate their own work and the work of their peers. The transforming power of the Arts is vividly experienced as students become conduits, connecting their humanity to generations of artists and audiences. The Performing Arts Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Learn and apply fundamentals skills and techniques such as the reading of music.

The curriculum is designed to provide students with the skills necessary to build a foundation of comprehensive wellness by learning to create and analyze individualized plans. The classes incorporate personal goal setting, exercise physiology, strength training, cardiovascular training, mindfulness, yoga, and interdependent thinking to promote lifelong patterns of healthy behavior.

We seek to live examined lives and explore faith by asking questions, encouraging spirited debate, and instilling a sense of wonder. Through religion classes we develop a deeper understanding of the basic tenants of Christian faith and how course material can help us in everyday life. Exploration of other world religions and philosophies encourages students to understand similarities and differences and the role that faith and religion plays in other countries and cultures. Science The Science Department believes that science is a process rooted in curiosity, awe, understanding and respect for the natural world in which we live. Students are encouraged to become autonomous learners in a collaborative environment. We teach students to be critical thinkers who use logic, experimental design, and problem solving as vehicles for discovery. Through a carefully constructed curriculum, our students develop scientific literacy, understand the research process, and hone effective communication skills. We apply the scientific method throughout a student\u2019s experience at St. Margaret\u2019s and empower budding scientists to formulate interesting questions, develop a hypothesis, design an experiment, analyze results, and report a thoughtful conclusion. Our students learn to think logically and critically and to transfer scientific knowledge and skills to other disciplines. It is our hope that students will mature into responsible stewards of the Earth and build lifelong interest in science.

At the core of the St. Margaret\u2019s art experience is developing ones personal passions. In a studio art environment students learn an array of mental habits such as visual-spatial abilities, reflection, self-criticism, and the willingness to experiment and learn from mistakes. Balance between process and product, tradition and innovation and understanding the art world presently and historically are essential to educating both the hearts and minds of our students. The Visual Arts Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Express idea, emotion and/or mood while cultivating personal voice Explore and use a variety of media while developing craft Self-evaluate, discuss, and critique individual and class projects Make individual aesthetic decisions and judgments related to their own artwork Understand art-making conceptually and through design elements Develop innovative artistic techniques while working within an art tradition Appreciate past and present artists and art movements Strive for excellence through practice, patience and persistence World Languages The World Languages Department prepares students, both linguistically and culturally, to communicate in a pluralistic global society.

From the dedicated team of library and educational technology specialists to the commanding 9-screen video wall, it provides heightened flexibility in dedicated spaces to support student learning, research, creation, collaboration, presentation and study needs. The St. Margaret\u2019s Library has been continually adapting and evolving to increase technological capabilities and respond to students\u2019 learning interests. The video display wall, as an example, can be configured in many different ways and allows for dynamic presentation capabilities for students and faculty, and additional showcase space for student work and important messages. Students come to the Library and Learning Commons to access information, literature and technology support. Beyond the collection of books, it provides a gateway to a vast catalog of credible web-based resources. Our program specializes in providing access to resources, tools for learning and expert guidance to research, analyze, and navigate the endless information at our students\u2019 fingertips. Students interact with rich media content and leading technology tools, work independently or collaboratively with classmates, and seek guidance from expert teachers. Our students also seek dynamic and introspective learning and studying places. From collaborative, flexible and comfortable work areas to private spaces that provide learners with solitude and quiet where they can get comfortable, focus and work independently, the space is configurable to meet the diverse learning styles of our students. Reading lounges also provide comfortable places for readers of all ages. Adjacent to the Learning Commons is a computer science and robotics lab, weaving together immersive technologies and innovation in a space designed to enhance collaboration and experiential learning. This state-of-the-art classroom provides a place where students and faculty from across multiple disciplines can discover and learn. In addition, a separate part of the Library is dedicated to Early School and Lower School students. By promoting literacy, a culture and love of reading, and ultimately self-interest and skills in storytelling, St. Margaret\u2019s Early School and Lower School students visit the Library weekly for engaging lessons and the opportunity to explore St. Margaret\u2019s collection of age-appropriate reading material. Angela Mackenzie, Director of Educational Technology and Library at St. Margaret\u2019s We continue to evolve our school library to ensure its important role in serving students of all ages. As the way students consume and access information innovates and adapts, so does St. Margaret\u2019s.

We are a school with a clear mission to educate the hearts and minds of young people for lives of learning, leadership and service. We are committed to knowing and loving each of our students as we guide them to discover passions, explore new pathways, establish healthy habits, and develop relationships that will nurture them throughout their Upper School experience and beyond. We are proud of our reputation as a school that combines a supportive, dynamic environment with high expectations, and we celebrate our students\u2019 extraordinary growth and accomplishments. Students arrive to the Upper School in the early years of adolescence, on the heels of grade 8, and leave as college freshmen, well prepared for the next step in their educational journey. During this transformation, we provide rich opportunities for the development of values, passions, and skills that lead to meaningful and successful lives. Curiosity, work ethic, resilience, empathy, creativity and kindness are skills and character traits we endeavor to grow and develop in these important formative years, because who our students are as people is as important as their academic success. The intimate size of the Upper School and faculty-student ratio allows for authentic and meaningful relationships to flourish between students and teachers. We offer a vigorous, relevant and innovative curriculum taught by expert faculty, of whom nearly 90 percent hold an advanced degree in their field. We offer a full range of honors and Advanced Placement courses to challenge and stretch our students in areas that are of interest to them, from humanities to STEAM courses. Courses such as software engineering, macroeconomics, multivariable calculus, wealth, poverty and ethics, and post AP Spanish allow students to individualize their program and pursue depth in areas of interest. Co-curricular opportunities are central to the St. Margaret\u2019s experience. We offer 24 varsity sports including football, cross country, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, volleyball, baseball and equestrian. Multiple athletics fields and gymnasiums serve as welcome host to many Tartan sports competitions that draw parents, guests and much of the student body together\u2014led by a highly-spirited student cheering section, fondly named \u201cThe Kitchen,\u201d outfitted with an assortment of food-related costumes. Our arts faculty supports a broad and exceptional arts programs in theater, concert band, orchestra, choir, dance and visual arts. Each year our young artists demonstrate unbridled creativity, dedication, and excellence through productions, concerts, exhibits and competitions, which are shared with our entire community. The opportunity to study and perform in the 45,000-square-foot Performing Arts Center supports our award-winning program. A glimpse into our everyday experience might include students and faculty sharing lunch in the Tartan Courtyard, a collaborative leadership meeting such as Peer Counselors, ASB or our Tartan Inclusivity and Diversity Education group where students and faculty meet to develop and execute programs that support our community. That same day, students may meet as an entire Upper School community for Convocation, also known as \u201cConvo,\u201d to hear students and faculty share important information, inspire others through a personal story and celebrate each other\u2019s accomplishments. They may also meet in an Advisory group which consists of 10 peers and a trusted faculty member who remain together throughout the four years of Upper School. In this space, they may discuss topics relevant to school and life beyond school or they may play a game and share a snack together. Our focus on service learning is ingrained in our school community, and endeavors to create meaningful relationships, contributions and lasting impact. Students work in advisory groups on special days built into the schedule to partner with local non-profit organizations that they choose, and build an ongoing relationship to support and serve their unique organizational needs. Students complete their service requirement during the school day. There is much to share about the St. Margaret\u2019s Upper School and we look forward to conversations with you about how our \u201ceveryday\u201d Tartan experience might be a right fit for you and your family.

Our community is distinguished by visible and compelling mutual respect, joy and vitality. Amy Roberts Principal, Upper School Upper School Honor Statement Conducting oneself honorably is essential to living a meaningful and successful life.

They can change the emphasis of the course of study to the serious interests that the seniors are developing and the eventual work that they might be able to do. . . [in] a serious senior project that would require practice in the qualities the seniors need to take to their next work, such as emotional stamina, making well-informed choices of what to study and create, managing time well and adjusting to change. Internships may often be an excellent adjunct to these projects, since they emphasize the learning that can come from experience and from colleagues.\" In the final weeks of the seniors' careers at St. Margaret's Episcopal School, students participate in Independent Senior Projects (ISPs). The main goal of the ISP program is to create a transition for the seniors from the structure of high school to the independence of college. We hope to give students a chance to apply their in-school learning to real world experiences outside the classroom, and to realize what life is like outside of a school setting. ISPs are a golden opportunity for students and the institution as a whole to demonstrate the effectiveness of the school's mission and core values. One of the hallmarks of a St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School education is a connection to the real world. Here, education is not pursued in a vacuum, as we strive to equip students with the habits of mind and the skills and knowledge to thrive. This self-designed educational experience pushes students to: Transition to an independent environment Apply classroom learning to real-life situations Constructively use time during and after AP exams worthy of ceasing instruction in other classes Allows all divisions to see the outcome of the high school experience essentially giving them a direction to aspire to. St. Margaret\u2019s wishes to strengthen the \u201cbridge\u201d between our school and the surrounding community. By reaching out to different groups in our community (parents, alumni, and local businesses) we will secure meaningful projects for our seniors. The Four Types of Independent Senior Projects: List of 4 items. 1. Internship or Apprenticeship Includes working with a business, artistic, educational or government organization to learn about a given field or career. 2. Service Learning Projects Allow students to expand their involvement with community service organizations and invest time and energy that is not ordinarily possible during the academic year. 3. Academic Inquiry May be interpreted broadly to include visual and performing arts, but also other creative endeavors such as independent research, writing, culinary arts, religious exploration \u2013 the possibilities are endless. 4. Job Allow students to acquire a job in their local area where they can work a minimum of 18 hours per week during the designated independent project period.

(Bring Your Own Device) technology philosophy to help create that landscape where learning is available for all students. Clearly, when students are already comfortable with their device, frustration is limited and time and energy can be directed toward learning. Our students may choose an iPad, a tablet from another provider, a Surface, or a full laptop based on their needs and preferences. Factors like \u201cconsuming\u201d versus \u201cproducing\u201d, number crunching capability, ease of mobility, cost, screen definition all play a role in student choice. We do expect each student to have a device, with greater functionality than a phone, with them at school each day. Most standard devices will be capable of scheduling, note taking, accessing online resources and managing any specific tools the faculty feel would aid the student. One observation that may be helpful is that many students move to a more powerful machine as they move through Upper School and they find their \u201cconsumer\u201d/ \u201cproducer\u201d needs change. Finally, we appreciate and fully leverage the importance and ubiquitous nature of technology in the fast and mobile world our students will graduate into. However, education is a uniquely human enterprise and we honor that by also deeply valuing relationship and putting inspiring faculty in front of your children each and every day.

Our Middle School program is designed to provide opportunities for students to engage in activities that support their growth as learners, leaders and compassionate members of the community who see the beauty and worth of all human beings. These three years are times of incredible growth for our students. Being surrounded by a community that cares for each other will build a sense of belonging and self-worth which will help them to think with their minds and their hearts throughout their lives. At St. Margaret\u2019s, we believe early adolescents should be exposed to a rich and vibrant program that enables them to explore challenges in diverse arenas. Our students thrive through their participation in academic , athletic , artistic and leadership programs . Small class sizes ensure that students are known and seen, which provides a safe and nurturing environment to have high academic expectations where taking intellectual risks are encouraged. Our enrichment program ensures all students are exposed to the full breadth of a liberal arts education and have the opportunity to pursue interests beyond the core curriculum. Watching our students grow through Upper School and successfully thrive in college and beyond provides us with continual feedback that our Middle School prepares students for the academic challenges of high school and university life. Yet, we are careful to measure the success of our students in more significant ways than test scores and grade-point averages. Although these are worthy goals and our students do quite well according to those measures, our program offers so much more to foster their development as people so that they can make their positive impact on others well after they leave St. Margaret\u2019s. With a focus on the education of the heart, the caring relationships with experienced faculty members help guide students towards the larger life lessons that will guide them throughout their lives. This critical aspect of our curriculum is certainly not delivered in the same manner as a math or English class. There is no textbook and no grade associated with these enduring lessons. They are delivered through authentic relationships, through learning from mistakes, through active self-reflection and mentoring conversations. Ultimately, our purpose is to work closely with students and their families to develop appropriate independence, resiliency and the skills necessary to pursue a meaningful life of learning, leadership and service. Thank you for your interest in St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. Please feel welcome to contact us for additional information as you consider our Middle School program for your family. Sincerely, Michael Allison Middle School Principal Middle School Creed We are committed to honesty, justice, and learning. We respect the dignity and worth of all human beings; their thoughts, feelings, and their individuality. We seek to celebrate and share the joy and creativity that emanate from the love of God. We strive to be responsible and contributing members of our families, our school community, and the world.

The combination of academic vigor with dynamic learning experiences blend together with a variety of extracurricular activities that encourage students to establish positive values for learning and life.

Our students thrive through their participation in academic, athletic, artistic, and leadership programs. Middle School Block Schedule The Middle School follows a patterned tumbling block schedule. Each block is 60 minutes long which allows for a variety of learning activities within the block. Breaks are spaced throughout the day so that students never meet for more than two blocks in a row on any given day. The weekly schedule also provides opportunities for the entire Middle School student body, grade levels, and advisory groups to meet each week. These \u201cCommunity Times\u201d are designed to build school culture, engage with our Episcopal identity, provide access to teachers during tutorials, gather grade levels together to talk about specific topics for their grade level, and for advisory groups to meet to focus on our social-emotional curriculum and diversity, equity and inclusion goals. The Middle and Upper Schools follow a similar weekly schedule enabling faculty to teach in both divisions as well as allowing Middle School students to accelerate, when appropriate, into Upper School courses. Middle School Leadership Middle School students are given many opportunities to demonstrate leadership. Opportunities range from formal, elected positions on the Middle School Student Council to student designed and led lunchtime clubs. The culture promotes and encourages student voice and engagement with the school experience. Middle School Service Learning Each grade level in St. Margaret\u2019s Middle School has established themes for its service learning focus of the year. The grade 6 theme is \u201cNavigate our environment.\u201d This theme is a focus of grade level class meetings as the team of sixth grade teachers helps our youngest Middle School students understand the logistics and culture of the Middle School. Their retreat day takes place off campus at the beach where students deepen their advisory bond with each other and their teachers, try new things and enjoy the Tartan community experience. In the fall the grade 6 students serve Second Harvest on the farm, support the all-Middle School project with Head Start Preschool and deepen their understanding and knowledge of the Tartan community and their family history through a cookbook project. The grade 7 theme is \u201cKnow and understand our community.\u201d As seventh graders work to develop their own identity, this theme provides students with opportunities to enhance their empathy and build the skills of cultural competency. With their focus on equity and hunger, the grade level will work with the local Head Start program, Capistrano Senior Living, our St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church and several other community partners. Their fall retreat will take place at the Irvine Spectrum and will allow for advisory groups to really enjoy some fun, quality bonding time together. The grade 8 theme is \u201cRespect the past and influence the future.\u201d Students work throughout the year to understand and support our troops and veterans. Work with our local Operation Help a Hero provides tangible experiences to connect with the needs of our current troops. Veterans Day presentations by local veterans and a project to interview a veteran further connect students to the importance of supporting our troops and honoring our veterans. Their fall retreat will be a day trip to Catalina where sunshine and adventure will pave the way for a fun day of community building. The end of the year class trip to Washington, D.C. provides a meaningful capstone experience. Middle School Chapel The Chapel service is integral to a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Our Episcopal tradition guides that regular participation in communal worship is the key to making individual spirituality blossom. Bringing our expansive diversity of backgrounds from each child into one unified presence in Chapel embraces our differences and creates the habits of prayer, compassion and devotion that are the foundations of worship to all views of a higher power we call God. Students are encouraged to participate in Chapel services in a variety of roles, including acolytes, readers, Eucharistic ministers and speakers. The Middle School attends Chapel services two times a week. Middle School Deans The structure of leadership in the Middle School provides for a dean at each grade level. These grade-level deans play a large role in the culture and communication for their respective grade levels. They organize and run class meetings, help with the cadence and events of advisory meetings, communicate regularly with teachers and students, and have a recognized and valuable voice with the Middle School administration. Due to their close relationship with the students and teachers in a given grade level, the deans are an important point of contact for students, parents, and teachers whenever the need might arise. Middle School Advisory The Middle School Advisory program is designed to provide each student with an adult mentor on campus who knows, cares for, and assists the student in navigating the academic, social and extracurricular experiences in the Middle School. These mixed-gender advisory groups will range in student size from 10-14 students. By being part of an advisory group, students have a guided opportunity to enhance their understanding of themselves, to expand relationships with other students, and to participate in programming that supports physical, social and emotional well-being. Middle School Clubs The Middle School has multiple teacher- and student-led clubs which meet during various lunch periods throughout the school year. These student-driven clubs provide students with the opportunity to organize and engage with an interested group of students. All clubs have a teacher as a support and guide, but the students themselves organize, lead and execute the club meetings. Middle School Tutorial Tutorial is a weekly period designed to allow students to meet with teachers to seek extra help or ask questions on classwork. Sometimes, teachers require students to attend tutorial to make up work, provide further guidance, and to check for content understanding. When students do not need individual time with a teacher, they are able to use tutorial to complete homework, study or work on long-term projects. To prepare students for the Upper School and life beyond, they are given increased freedom in how they choose to use their tutorial time as they progress through the Middle School.

Whether it be our commitment to small class sizes with classroom and special subject teachers engaged in the learning of each child, robust science, technology, engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) programs, our excellence in teaching language arts and the humanities, a vibrant visual arts and music program, or our support in developing the whole child through our training in positive behavior support systems and character education, we continue to grow professionally and adapt our program in order to meet the needs of each and every student at St. Margaret\u2019s. Leadership Through Character Development Our faculty and students are proud to live by the six pillars of the Character Counts program: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship. Our Lower School Student Leadership, faculty and parents work hard to continue to model and teach each of these character traits. Our first weeks of school focus on behavioral expectations for life at St. Margaret\u2019s. Homeroom and Specialist teachers, Co-Teachers, and administrators model and teach these traits and guide students in making good decisions in their social, emotional and academic lives. St. Margaret\u2019s Tartans are taught pro-social behavior as they learn to navigate their ever-changing minds and bodies. We reward this PAWsitive behavior with Class Dojo points, incentives, special privileges and much more. Our professional community instills morals and values in fun and engaging ways. There are spirit days and reward days where the excitement is almost palpable and all the while the children are reminded that PAWsitive character is what great leaders are made of. Service Through Community Our community consists of our students, professional community, and families. We foster an atmosphere in which all feel they have a voice and an integral part in the St. Margaret\u2019s family. We work hard to enhance communication with parents and students through regular face-to-face, web and email-based correspondence. We communicate each child\u2019s progress through the use of a custom-designed \u2018progress report showing achievement toward or above benchmark over time. We host grade-level meetings, parent workshops, and send weekly grade-level newsletters that center on social, emotional, and academic well-being. The students feel a strong sense of community and school spirit through our dynamic Student Leadership groups. Exciting information is shared with our students regarding PAWsitive character events and incentives throughout the year via student-generated videos shown each Monday in Chapel . The administrative team is committed to building strong relationships with all professional community members. These strong relationships then foster a community in which we participate in seasonal and yearlong service learning . These service opportunities are intentionally tied to the social science, science, social justice standards, and social emotional curriculum while also using the themes in the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals . As a St. Margaret\u2019s alumni and parent, I can personally attest to the way our Lower School prepares students for the academic challenges of Middle School , Upper School and university life . Like our Middle School, we are careful to measure the success of our students in more significant ways than just through test scores. We measure our program and the needs of each child through various forms of assessment and use this data to drive instruction. Our program offers so much to foster the development of the whole child. Thank you for your interest in St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. Please feel welcome to contact us for additional information as you consider our Lower School program for your family.

The nearly 400 Lower School students are supported by a low student-to-teacher ratio of credentialed and experienced homeroom teachers and co-teachers, and special subjects teachers who deliver differentiated and individualized instruction to each child. The Lower School program is taught in a traditional setting with the structure of the day built around the developmental age of students at each grade level. All Lower School students begin their day with Chapel, which is a time to join together in community and celebration, and then move through a day filled with core and special subjects, including, art, computer science and engineering, digital literacy, spiritual practice, music, science and physical education. Our teachers are committed to delivering a robust curriculum using research-based strategies and materials. Pro-social behavior is taught and reinforced through the integration of a nationwide Positive Behavioral Support system that is woven into the fabric of our days. Although academic development lies at the heart of our mission, we remain committed to shaping the entire young person through spiritual, artistic, social and physical experiences. Each student is assessed and their needs are determined and met through both whole and small group instruction. Certain students receive support or enrichment through our partnership with the Learning and Enrichment Center along with support from our Reading Specialist. Students are afforded the opportunity to participate in a number of After School Clubs, be both a performer or audience member in our outstanding Arts department as well as be a participant in both Lower School and All-School events.

Adjacent to the classrooms for the kindergarten and grade 1 students it serves, the Outdoor Classroom features an edible growing garden, a sand pit, water tables, art stations, small and large building areas, a tricycle loop, reading nooks, an outdoor performance stage, mature trees, an enchanted fairy garden and large playground equipment\u2014swings, tires, and a rope climber. Students are able to explore the Outdoor Classroom during unstructured time throughout the day, and teachers utilize the space as a living laboratory for class time. The Outdoor Classroom nurtures learning in our youngest Lower School students in unique ways. St. Margaret\u2019s has a K-1 Outdoor Classroom teacher who conducts science lessons in the space, in addition to collaborating with St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School visual arts teacher and homeroom teachers to design curriculum and provocations tailored for this unique outdoor setting. Ample unstructured time in outside environments throughout the student\u2019s day also nurtures kinesthetic, creativity, problem solving, interpersonal and critical thinking skills. The Outdoor Classroom fosters gross and fine motor development, and engages multiple senses in the learning process at once, which increases permanence. Time spent in nature, itself, is proven to reduce stress, anxiety, improve observation and causation skills and cognitive focus. The Outdoor Classroom was designed by St. Margaret\u2019s faculty in partnership with the Outdoor Classroom Project, the leader in outdoor education research and innovation for young children, that also supported St. Margaret\u2019s development of the renowned Early Childhood School Outdoor Classroom. The creators envisioned a vibrant, welcoming, thoughtful environment that supports student choice through high-quality, experiential spaces, numerous and varied activities to best optimize the meaningful benefits and facilitate the kind of learning and healthy development in young children that only takes place outdoors. Through the partnership with the Outdoor Classroom Project, St. Margaret\u2019s engages outdoor education experts in ongoing faculty professional development. Lower School Principal Jennifer Blount \u201cWe believe learning occurs everywhere and all of the time. We created the Outdoor Classroom to be as richly and thoughtfully equipped as all our learning environments including traditional indoor classrooms. The Outdoor Classroom and corresponding curriculum for grade K and 1 students reflects St. Margaret\u2019s commitment to the countless and proven benefits of student learning and healthy development through ample time in outdoor, experiential spaces.\u201d Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom Lower School Grades K \u2013 1 Outdoor Classroom St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

Chapel All Lower School students begin their day, Monday \u2013 Thursday, coming together in the peaceful and centering setting of Chapel. They enter the doors and are greeted by teachers and administrators and sit with their classmates and teacher. In the Episcopal tradition, they sing, learn from a daily homily, pray, reflect and start the day anew. All are welcome and encouraged to participate, and often other religious holidays and traditions are observed. St. Margaret\u2019s chaplains incorporate one of our six character words: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship, into the homily messages. There are times each month when homilies are delivered by other members of our professional community. Each Monday, our student leadership teams deliver video presentations including events for the week, character trait reminders, action steps toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and special announcements. Beginning in grade 3, students serve as acolytes, readers, and assist with the Chapel technology. It is just one of many leadership opportunities in the Lower School. Classroom Time Following Chapel, students return to the classroom where they take part in a classroom meeting to connect with their teachers, classmates and the day\u2019s work ahead. The daily schedule is purposefully designed for each grade level to allow for the right amount of consecutive classroom learning as well as breaks throughout the day in the form of snack, recess, lunch and special subject classes. The morning consists of classroom instruction and possibly one of the seven special subject classes: art, computer science and engineering, digital literacy, spiritual practice, music, science and physical education. Students take a break for snack and play time. They participate in a number of outdoor activities during recess and lunch including: basketball, handball, soccer, kickball, builder boards, oversized Legos and wooden blocks, tetherball, reading, or in the Exploration Zone complete with arts and crafts, board games and more. We realize that students need a variety of options to choose from each day during their free time. After recess, most students have a large block for math. The Lower School uses the Everyday Math program including math fact fluency, computer games and extensions. Lunch is followed by another large consecutive block of time for English Language Arts instruction. Kindergarten through grade 5 reading instruction follows Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. These are research-based, student-centered approaches to teaching life-long readers and writers. Interspersed into the daily schedule is the teaching of social and emotional learning in the form of class meetings as well as social sciences taught in thematic units throughout the school year. Classroom Design Lower School classrooms were completely remodeled in 2014, specially designed for young learners. Each classroom is equipped with moveable tables and chairs to foster quick reorganization of the classroom for different kinds of activities and instruction. A classroom can be set in rows facing the front of the classroom, grouped into tables for cooperative work, or even stacked within minutes for a completely open floor in which students can be seated on the carpet for a number of activities. Each classroom has custom designed cubbies or lockers to house student books, sweaters, supplies and personal items. In order to reduce distractions within the classrooms, each room has a \u2018distraction free\u2019 wall in which only the interactive white boards (Promethean) are present. All other items are purposefully beautifully displayed on the thematic bulletin boards around the room. Students use laptops in grades K-2 and one-to-one Surface Tablets in grades 3-5, and classrooms are equipped with document cameras. Pawsitive Tartans! We are committed to the social, emotional and academic growth of each and every child. In terms of social growth, we have adopted the nationwide Positive Behavior Support (PBS) system in which pro-social behavior is thoughtfully taught to each student. Students participate in a \u201cPassport Walk\u201d twice a year. It is during these times, that expected behaviors in the classroom, Chapel, outdoors, on the bus, etc., are reinforced. Students are recognized with PAWsitives whenever they are seen doing the right thing, which is often and all over! They are then able to redeem these PAWsitives for special privileges throughout the year. Lower School News List of 3 news stories.

Our early childhood program is designed to engage the youngest learners to develop socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively through developmentally appropriate practices rich in social connections, language, literacy, math and other disciplinary skills and content. More than 100 years of research has shown us the importance of children\u2019s learning through play and exploration. Current research only solidifies the understanding that children learn best when they are actively and mentally engaged in their own learning. St. Margaret\u2019s knowledgeable and experienced educators facilitate and guide students with well thought strategies and environments that motivate and encourage preschool-age learners to investigate, question, problem solve and discover. In the classroom, children learn to navigate friendships by sharing materials, taking turns and taking perspective of others\u2019 ideas. Cognitive skills are further developed through investigation and exploration. Teachers provide materials and activities that develop literacy, numeracy and scientific thinking. Children are encouraged to question, create, problem-solve and explore. The learning does not end in the classroom. The nationally recognized Outdoor Classroom is purposefully designed for children to discover the natural world by spending time observing and feeding chickens, building with blocks, planting in the garden, catching rollie pollies, and watching caterpillars change over time. The Outdoor Classroom also helps children strengthen their physical abilities through riding bikes, climbing, lifting and dancing. The Early School is a wonderful place for preschool-age learners to develop a foundation for a love of learning through a socially and academically vigorous learning environment. Dr. Cris Lozon, Director, Early School St. Margaret\u2019s Early Childhood School is committed to providing quality care based on our knowledge of current research and best practices.

Ongoing assessment of children\u2019s progress includes the gathering of anecdotal records, digital photographs, developmental checklists and work samples. Annual speech, hearing and vision screenings in the fall and the results of nationally normed developmental screenings (fall and spring) are added to the child\u2019s portfolio to share with parents at two formal conferences each year. Parents also have an opportunity to participate in assessing their child\u2019s development with a parent-report developmental screen, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. All this information gives us a picture of a child\u2019s development and alerts us if more information and support is needed to help a child reach his or her potential. The St. Margaret\u2019s Early School plans curriculum to support all areas of a child\u2019s development: cognitive, social, emotional, physical and creative. Our curriculum meets or exceeds the California Preschool Learning Foundations, aligns with goals for young children\u2019s learning from the National Association for the Education of Young Children and serves as the foundation for the St. Margaret\u2019s kindergarten curriculum. Learning in preschool is hands-on and integrated. A child\u2019s time outside chasing insects in the garden, for instance, incorporates all the \u201cdispositions for learning\u201d as well as cognitive development: science (\u201cWhat kind of bug is this?\u201d \u201cWhat do they eat?\u201d); math (\u201cIs it larger or smaller than the other one?\u201d \u201cHow many did you find today?\u201d); language (\u201cMonarch Butterflies are orange and black.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s make up a poem about butterflies!\u201d); social skills (\u201cHow can we all see?\u201d \u201cYou can have a turn next.\u201d); physical development (running after the butterfly, carefully stepping around plants, manipulating the butterfly net); and creative (painting a picture of the butterfly in its habitat. Dancing and moving like one.) Learning is everywhere and happening all the time supported by teachers skilled at looking for and creating moments of discovery and learning based on children\u2019s needs and interests.

Children explore and create using a variety of drawing tools, paints, clay, paper, wire, loose parts, natural items and more. By having art materials available everyday, children gain competence with them and are likely to use them in new and more sophisticated ways. Classroom teachers work closely with the Atelierista (art studio teacher) to extend children\u2019s thinking in the Atelier. The Atelier is a place where children are both artists and scientists as they engage with traditional art materials alongside technology to investigate the natural world, express their ideas, and formulate new questions to further their inquiry. Engaging in art as an expressive language as well as a form in inquiry cultivates and strengthens persistence, creativity, problem solving, and flexibility. It also supports children\u2019s understanding of spatial relationships and physics, perspective and proportion, as well as strengthens development in areas such as fine motor dexterity. From using a digital microscope to look at a flower more closely, to creating a sculpture from clay to be fired in our kiln, the children are offered a wide array of experiences, building a foundation for future art and science thinking. Physical Development We plan fine and gross motor activities each day both inside and outside. St. Margaret\u2019s has a full-time Perceptual Motor Specialist who sets up motor experiences that stimulate the body systems to gain strength, balance and coordination. Activities are planned to meet children\u2019s needs based on observations, collaboration with classroom teachers and developmental assessments . Activities such as using eye droppers and squeeze bottles to water plants, manipulating art materials to create a masterpiece, pouring and measuring for cooking activities and playing with playhouse people are the foundation skills that build strength in muscles used for writing. Through motor activities the children will: Gain confidence and good body image Learn to control eye-hand coordination Develop fine motor dexterity and control as a foundation for writing Demonstrate balance and control during loco-motor movements Use muscles to manipulate objects and control environment Dramatic Play/Drama Children don\u2019t need much encouragement to pretend and engage in dramatic play. It is second nature to them. They\u2019ll create it in the playhouse (in or outside) in the sandbox, with unit blocks and animals and people inside, with the hollow blocks and hard hats outside, on bikes, in the garden... everywhere! In dramatic play, the children will: Use their creativity and imagination Work out fears and worries Sort through their understandings of fantasy and reality Try on roles, learn about their world Enhance vocabulary and receptive (listening) and expressive (speaking) language skills Gain the ability to plan, organize & clean up! Develop focus and concentration Practice self-regulation and problem-solving Explore concepts of \u201cfair\u201d and practice turn-taking, cooperation and sharing Use symbolic thought Retell and reenact events in stories Language & Literacy Books (story books, non-fiction or poetry) are read to children each day at group time and one-on-one throughout the day both inside and outside. Children have flannel board stories to retell favorites or create their own. Children make individual or class books to document experiences and celebrate the imagination. We provide children with opportunities for meaningful conversations with us and each other throughout the day. Through dramatic play, table top games, group time activities and casual conversations with teachers and each other, the children will: Practice listening, asking and responding to questions Be encouraged to express ideas, develop age-appropriate grammar and learn new vocabulary Develop phonemic and phonological awareness by: playing with the sounds of words, matching sounds and rhymes, clapping out syllables, predicting story outcomes Identify the alphabet as a special category of symbols Recognize beginning letters in familiar words and associate letters with sounds Discover that letters make up words and words make up sentences Begin to think of themselves as authors by beginning to understand that books are \u201ctalk written down\u201d, Listen to and make up their own stories and poems Enjoy representing their own ideas through drawing or dictation Experiment with writing to communicate ideas, including writing their name Move along the reading continuum Mathematics Math is everywhere\u2014inside and outside. Children love to count and compare things. Through blocks, science and nature activities, dramatic play, art, music and movement the children will build foundation skills in arithmetic, geometry and algebra. The children will: Show 1-to-1 correspondence as part of counting and numeracy skills 0-9 Understand and demonstrate concepts of more and less Demonstrate understanding of sets and ordering (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) Recognize and manipulate basic shapes and discover spatial relationships Classify and sort by attributes (color, size, shape) Extend and create patterns Learn by making estimations and graphs Experiment with measurement (standard and unconventional) Learn and have fun! Music The St. Margaret\u2019s Early School music program strives to nurture a joy of music making in students and to foster an appreciation of natural and found sounds in our students\u2019 environments. Students are introduced to the rudiments of melody, harmony, and rhythm; central tenements to building a solid foundation in music appreciation and music making.

Andrews Outdoor Classroom Named for Faculty Emeritus Ingrid S. Andrews, a 35-year founding faculty member and longtime ES director, is the centerpiece of the Early School campus. It is a place where young learners can immerse themselves in nature, hone observation skills, practice persistence and cooperation, develop academic concepts and physical skills and learn problem solving skills and, of course\u2014play and have fun. The first school in Orange County to be designated with a \u201cRecognized Outdoor Classroom Site\u201d by the Outdoor Classroom Project *, the ES Outdoor Classroom is a science lab, artist\u2019s studio, a library, symphony hall, theater and gym. Inspired by the work about nature deficit disorder from author Richard Louv, St. Margaret\u2019s commitment to providing an outdoor environment and curriculum that nurtures growth and learning for the whole child. All children need and benefit from abundant time outdoors positively impacting development and learning and critical for physical health. For children ages 0 to 5, development and learning outdoors is often easier, more productive and beneficial. Full development and integration of outdoor and indoor programs creates the optimal learning and growing environment for young children. The outdoor learning program promotes healthy lifestyle for young children, creates a respect for the earth and provides inviting spots for play and learning. All Early School classrooms open to the Outdoor Classroom where students spend much of their day. Learning by doing in an outdoor environment supports physical, social and emotional growth, as well as growth across the curriculum: math, science, language and literacy, social studies, art, music and drama. Being outside nurtures the dispositions for learning (creativity, persistence, collaboration, problem solving and communication) that we know leads to lifelong learning. *The Outdoor Classroom Project was created by the Child Educational Center, a nationally accredited program of early childhood education which cultivated the concept and practice of Outdoor Classrooms. To receive the designation of a Recognized Outdoor Classroom Site, St. Margaret\u2019s Early Childhood School faculty attended a series of classes over several years, undertook a self-study, made a commitment to the Outdoor Classroom philosophy and passed a site evaluation by members of the Outdoor Classroom Project Board of Directors.

As a college-preparatory institution that sends off many of its graduates to further study STEAM areas in college, St. Margaret\u2019s offers a challenging STEAM curriculum and program that prepares students for future careers in a variety of fields. Programs such as computer science and engineering begin at a young age and build year over year, engaging our students in a love of STEAM disciplines and challenging them to reach their highest potential. Increasingly, our academic team has put a stronger emphasis on integrating the curriculum so that students can experience projects similar to how they are incorporated into STEAM fields in the industry. Among other innovative methods, we have incorporated the use of the design thinking process from Stanford University\u2019s d.school, that is critical to creation, innovation and invention. St. Margaret\u2019s STEAM program serves our students\u2019 natural interest, engages them through experiential, project-based curriculum, allows them to make sense of the technological world, builds critical and creative thinking and higher-order reasoning skills, and prepares them for college majors and careers in science, technology, engineering and math fields. Further, our students and teachers understand the importance and interdisciplinary nature of STEAM concepts today and their evolution in the future, and feel the reach of STEAM into their everyday lives. Classrooms from different disciplines frequently come together to explore STEAM fields in an interdisciplinary way, such as engineering and visual arts, computer science and algebra, and life sciences with personal fitness and wellness. Our students see the beauty of scientific phenomena, understand how technology can be used to solve everyday problems, marvel at the engineering of everyday objects in both form and function, and see the applications that math has every day. Our students are enthused by these fields and desire to be lifelong learners in these areas, during and after their time at St. Margaret\u2019s.

Early study of computer science and engineering at St. Margaret\u2019s is a unique opportunity to leverage the inherent predispositions of these digital natives growing up in a technologically enriched world. All students today must be digitally literate from a young age to successfully navigate school years into adulthood. Further, we know that our ever-evolving technological world needs future generations of computer scientists, engineers and programmers who will identify opportunities and create solutions only they can envision. St. Margaret\u2019s offers a comprehensive and advanced computer science curriculum grades Kindergarten through 12. The academic study of computer science and engineering begins in Kindergarten and focuses on robotics, simple machines and computer coding. Robotics and simple machines are an excellent tool for introducing and exploring engineering, stimulating imaginative thinking and providing real world meaning to otherwise abstract concepts through hands-on learning. In Kindergarten and grade 1, students begin basic programming with the use of Bee-Bots, a programmable floor robot, acquiring sequencing, strategizing and problem-solving skills . Students in grades 1 -6 move on to more advanced LEGO Robotics. Students begin with the essentials, learning about the benefits of simple machines such as levers, pulleys, gears, wheels and axles. They work with partners to build a robot from pre-defined directions and then move to a challenge, creating their own robot working within a set of parameters to create a solution. Building and programming robots introduces and fosters critical computational thinking skills behind programming of identifying a problem, breaking it down into smaller pieces, developing a strategy or algorithm to solve it, and troubleshooting when it doesn\u2019t work as expected. It also nurtures collaboration with other students, persistence and creativity. In addition to coding with Bee-Bots, computer programming continues to instill computational thinking with Scratch Jr., a graphical computer programming language, taught in grades K \u2013 2. In grades 3 \u2013 4, students build on basic coding skills advancing to Scratch, a block based visual programming language. In grades 5 \u2013 6, students combine their knowledge of robotics and coding, to program their own robot to perform a variety of tasks using LEGO Mindstorm. In the Middle School, grades 7 and 8, students transition from graphical programming to text-based programming using the language LUA, coding with the app Codea on their iPads. The computer science curriculum advances in the Upper School with higher level computer programming classes in three different computer languages, Processing, Python and Java. Students can then move on to two Advanced Placement courses, AP computer programming and AP computer principles, as well as two post-AP courses, software engineering and mobile apps development.

Our students require and thrive in technology-rich, dynamic learning environments. St. Margaret\u2019s continues to evolve and reimagine learning spaces across our campus and bring leading technology and tools to meet the needs of these digital natives. Our state-of-the-art computing environment and robust wireless infrastructure throughout our 22-acre campus provide students access to robust resources that support their digital literacy and teaching and learning across all disciplines. The classrooms at St. Margaret\u2019s are modern, technology-enriched learning spaces that allow for heightened connectivity to networks, interactivity among devices in the room, wireless display capabilities, and collaboration among students, teachers and even outside experts relevant to a learning experience. Our professional community has demonstrated a clear ability to rethink pedagogy and curriculum with an aim toward using technology to enhance the learning experience and prepare students for learning and working in the technology world, whether through unique course offerings or enhancing learning in traditional subjects. St. Margaret\u2019s also recognizes that an increasingly high-tech world means an increased need for education around digital citizenship and responsible use of technology. St. Margaret\u2019s has partnered with multiple organizations around this topic, including The Social Institute and Common Sense Media. Bringing education around technology use into the classroom ensures that our students are empowered to strike a healthy balance with technology and positively portray oneself online in order to be good digital citizens that make the world a better place. In addition to classroom technology, St. Margaret\u2019s also has innovative classroom labs to further technology-specific education. This includes the iLab as part of the Lower School STEAM Center, a computer science lab in the Middle School, and a computer science and robotics lab in the Library which houses design and fabrication tools and is home to programs such as robotics and esports. St. Margaret\u2019s also has technology carts for educational programming in virtual reality and augmented reality, with educational touchpoints around these tools and makerspaces continuing to expand. St. Margaret\u2019s students also have a device program where K-8 students are issued school-provided iPads at the beginning of the school year. In this program, every Lower School and Middle School student receive their own iPad, with Middle School students having the privilege to take their device home for homework and studying. Through this program, St. Margaret\u2019s oversees the learning applications downloaded to the device, helping teachers streamline activities and assignments using platforms that all students have. The Upper School, meanwhile, has a bring-your-own-device model, where students can use a device they may already be comfortable with as an aid for studying and learning.

It\u2019s an outdoor science lab and a social meeting hub. It is a place where classroom learning and experiential education converge. This all-school garden is a place where students learn concepts with far wider application than growing a vegetable for the first time or watching soil decompose to make renewed, nutritious earth. Rather the focus can be on understanding delayed gratification, waiting for that one perfect strawberry to turn a deep shade of red, or the role that life cycles play in our interconnectedness. The school garden is an outdoor classroom where students engage their intellectual curiosity and are encouraged to discover something new. This leads to a sense of wonder and appreciation for our natural world, and a commitment to preserving and protecting these experiences for others. Each season the garden transitions to the next with the help of students and faculty, to be a lively space where edible food is the byproduct of hard work, patience, and science. Vegetables, such as beets, broccoli, snap peas, squash, lettuce, radishes and carrots are harvested. Students savor the taste of something they had a hand in growing, this is the ultimate connection. Sometimes, the Garden\u2019s harvest is donated to local organizations, adding service to the learning that takes place.

Middle and Upper School students may take dance to fulfill both their P.E. and their Fine Arts Credits as part of their regular school day. In the Upper School there are two levels of dance offered. Students in these classes study and perform in a variety of genres including ballet, tap, jazz, contemporary, and hip-hop technique. Dance classes also include yoga and Pilates-based conditioning to increase flexibility and strength. Instruction focuses on correct postural alignment, coordination, rhythmic patterns, fundamental dance positions, dance history and terminology. These courses emphasize essential life skills such as concentration, self-discipline, precision, goal-setting, confidence-building, self-expression, teamwork, effective communication and responsibility. The Dance Program produces two All-School Dance Concerts each year, which showcase both faculty and student choreography. Students are also introduced to the art of choreography and encouraged to creatively express themselves through guided exercises and group projects. Theater Theater at St. Margaret's is a process-oriented, experientially-based program available to students in grades 1 through 12. In the Lower School, dramatic play in the classroom sows the seeds of exploring the world of drama. Children participate in acting out stories, their own stories and ones from classroom literature. The Lower School produces two full-scale musicals with an open casting policy; every child who wishes to participate receives a role. The Lower School has a musical for students in grades 4 and 5 and another musical for students in grades 2-3. In the Middle School, every student in grade 6 takes theater, in a rotating schedule with other enrichment courses. Students in grades 7 and 8 may enroll in theater, a semester-long elective. The Middle School musical and play offers students opportunities to participate not only as actors, but in backstage and technical positions as well. The Upper School offers four University of California approved classes: Theater, Intermediate Theater, Advanced Theater and Honors Theater. Over the course of the academic year, there are two full theater productions, including a drama and a musical. The technical and design positions are held almost entirely by students in the Upper School.

Instruction in each discipline combines classroom interaction with technology-supported learning tools. All of our ensembles have two major concert performances each year in December and April, along with additional performing opportunities in collaboration with musical theater productions, chapel services, and other St. Margaret\u2019s community functions. Music Program Offerings List of 3 items. Band The Band Program offers a two-year introductory sequence in concert band instruments in the Lower School (oboe, flute, clarinet, bassoon, saxophones, trumpet, trombone, french horn, tuba, percussion) that combines individual instruction with ensemble practice and performance through a curriculum based on the Essential Elements 2000 series. The Middle School Band has both grade-level and combined rehearsals each week. The Upper School Concert Band studies and performs major works from the wind ensemble repertoire. The Upper School Jazz Combo is an advanced group focusing on small-ensemble training and improvisation in the performance of Jazz standards. Choir The Choir Program begins in the Lower School, with rudimentary training in solf\u00e8ge, diaphragmatic breathing, posture and improvisational singing. Students are exposed to repertoire in many different genres and time periods, as well the opportunity to sing in several different languages. The Middle School choir continues this training at a more advanced level, as well as affording students more solo opportunities. Choir at this level also offers an auditioned choral experience with the Tartan Chorale, open to all students in the Middle School. This ensemble meets once per week, studying more advanced repertoire and providing a more focused experience in true choral singing. The Upper School Highlander Chorale is a co-curricular class, designed to give the average and advanced singer the skills necessary to become adept at singing in many styles and genres. Students learn more advanced techniques of proper vocal production and have varied experiences in ensemble and solo singing. Chorale also provides students with a strong sense of commitment to the ensemble and pride in working together toward long- and short-range goals. Orchestra The Orchestra Program offers a comprehensive ensemble experience for students in every division at St. Margaret's. The Lower School String Orchestra combines individual instruction with ensemble practice and performance through a multifaceted curriculum that focuses on developing strong basic skills in music literacy and the interpretation of music. The Middle School Orchestra offers introductory training in the symphonic tradition of Haydn and Mozart to string, woodwind, brass, and percussion students. The Upper School Orchestra explores a vast symphonic repertoire starting with Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Schubert. Finally, Chamber Music offers advanced students the opportunity to study Sonatas, Piano Trios, String Quartets, Wind Quintets, and more. Annually, orchestra ensembles at the school regularly collaborate with theater, band and choir. Music Studies List of 3 items. Advanced Placement Music Theory The formal study of music theory gives students a thorough background in which to develop the ability to recognize, understand, and describe the basic materials and processes of music that are heard or presented in a score. The achievement of these goals is approached by initially addressing fundamental aural, analytical, and compositional skills using both listening and written exercises. Building on this foundation, the course progresses to include more creative tasks such as the harmonization of a melody by selecting appropriate chords, composing a musical bass line to provide two-voice counterpoint, and the realization of figured-bass notation. Subjects covered include melody, harmony, texture, rhythm, form, musical analysis, elementary composition, and to some extent, history and style along with Musicianship skills such as dictation, sight-singing, and keyboard harmony. This course makes use of the Practica Musica education training software. Early Childhood Our early childhood program in music for students in preschool through grade 3 introduces students to the world of music through an organized series of presentations, games, and hands-on activities that promote an awareness and appreciation for the art form. Music basics are taught that allow students a seamless transition into our ensemble music programs beginning in grade 4. Private Instruction Beyond ensemble training, our music staff also offers optional one-on-one weekly lessons for students in every subject. We encourage our students to take private lessons on campus to augment their skills and improve the quality of their ensemble experience.

At the core of the St. Margaret\u2019s art experience is developing one\u2019s personal passions. In a studio art environment, students are given choice and agency while partnering with experienced arts educators. As students develop the tools to express themselves, they often find that they are also on a journey of self-discovery. No matter what path students take, whether looking to shape and influence their world or to simply have a place to decompress, it is our hope that everyone has a space they can call their own to figure out what matters most to them. The Visual Arts faculty\u2019s philosophy is to make everyone feel they are meant to be here and do this creative work together. We feel creating spaces that make students feel supported and remind them why wonder, exploration, and creative thought matter, not only nurtures students but also creates more engagement, thoughtful conversations, and perhaps more meaningful artwork. We hope students' creative acts are seen on a daily basis in a way that self-expression becomes part of a balanced and well-lived life. Student artwork is on display throughout the campus year-round. Visual Arts exhibitions include the Fall Art Show, the annual K-12 Student Art Show showcasing more than 200 pieces of student work, the Scholastic online exhibit, and the Senior AP Art Pop-Up Show. St. Margaret's visual art students regularly participate in the OC Art of the Year contest, the National K-12 Ceramics Exhibition, the Scholastic Art and Writing contest, and Young Arts. Students also engage with professional artists as part of an artist-in-residence program and go on art trips to gain real-world experience. Visual Arts Course Offerings List of 4 items.

The Darcy Rice Center for the Arts, designated an All-Steinway School for Excellence, is first and foremost a teaching and learning facility supporting instrumental music, choral music, dance and theater education and programs in dedicated learning environments that have been designed with each artistic discipline in mind. Two professional performance theaters provide optimum venues to spotlight student talent across all performing arts disciplines.

The Center includes three dedicated, acoustically optimized music teaching rooms for orchestra, concert band and choir, a professional dance studio, 11 private practice rooms, a sound and video production studio, capabilities to professionally record from all interior studios and music rooms, a professional costume studio with over 25,000 costume pieces, the 450-seat proscenium-style Marcus D. Hurlbut Theater, and the intimate, black-box-style, 150-seat McGregor Family Theater that is also used as the drama teaching space. Dusk 5 Dusk 6 Theater-5 All-Steinway Designation Upon the opening of the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts in August 2012, St. Margaret\u2019s received the prestigious distinction as an All-Steinway School from Steinway & Sons, builders of the finest pianos in the world. According to Steinway & Sons, to earn the distinction of an All-Steinway School, an institution must demonstrate a commitment to excellence by providing its students and faculties with the best equipment possible for the study of music. All pianos owned by All-Steinway Schools, from the practice room to the recital hall, are designed by Steinway & Sons. Each Steinway-designed piano in the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts was new and delivered when the center opened in August 2012. Among St. Margaret\u2019s collection is a Steinway Model D Concert Grand Piano for the Marcus D. Hurlbut Theater, three Steinway-designed 5\u2019 10\u201d Performance Edition Boston Grand Pianos that outfit the Choir Room and Concert Band Room and the Orchestra Room. Additionally, there is a new Performance Edition Institutional upright Boston Piano in each of the Performing Arts Center\u2019s 11 practice rooms. When presenting St. Margaret\u2019s the distinction, President of Steinway & Sons Ron Losby said, \u201cIt truly is my honor to be here and after what I have just seen briefly walking through this extraordinary facility, I am humbled by having our name attached to such a beautiful school.

Over the next thirty years, Henry and his sons, C. F. Theodore, Charles, Henry Jr., William, and Albert, developed the modern piano. They built their pianos one at a time, applying skills that were handed down from master to apprentice, generation after generation. Today, Steinway still builds pianos that way. Each Steinway grand piano, for example, takes nearly a year to create. Nothing is hurried. Even the carefully selected woods employed in the rims, tops, soundboards, and actions cure for months in its yard, kilns and conditioning rooms, until they stabilize at a rigidly specified moisture content. Steinway is dedicated to the ideal of making the finest pianos in the world. The result is instruments renowned for their unsurpassed quality. Pianos with such superior sound and responsive touch that they enchant the most demanding pianists. Steinway pianos are preferred overwhelmingly by people who share the joy of playing and owning the finest musical instrument. To view the list of All-Steinway Schools, please click here . PRESIDENT OF STEINWAY & SONS RON LOSBY \u201cOut of the 150 All-Steinway schools throughout the world, I can only think of one who is in a similar category to St. Margaret\u2019s. Most of them are schools such as the Curtis Institute of Music, the Royal College of Music, or the Beijing Central Conservatory; they\u2019re extraordinary institutions in their own right because they are dedicated to excellence. And, this obviously is the case here at St. Margaret\u2019s as well.\" St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

An ardent supporter of the athletic programs, John Balak's friendly smile and encouraging word will forever be etched in the minds of the athletes who were fortunate enough to know him. The recipient of this award is the person that the coaches of St. Margaret's feel best emulates the life and perspective of this fine man. The John Balak Award winner is unselfish, dedicated to their sport and school, and models a work ethic that every coach desires from his athletes. The student is an athlete that demonstrates respect for his/her teammates, coaches, and the opposing team. The individual is fiercely competitive but makes the distinction between hatred and competition. The most important trait the John Balak Award winner emulates is integrity. You can count on this person to give it their best, to take responsibility for their performance, and to praise their teammates for a win.

Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens through formal and informal opportunities that work to advance justice on behalf of all members of our community and the world. In all aspects of their school lives, St. Margaret's students are provided leadership opportunities and are able to initiate, explore, and practice leadership skills in a safe and encouraging environment. Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens and leaders through formal and informal opportunities. Leadership development in our students is actively promoted across all divisions at the classroom, division and school-wide levels through a cohesive program of leadership opportunities and development at the school. Students have the opportunity to demonstrate leadership on the athletic field, on stage, in service, or to better the culture and climate of the school community. Leadership, however, is not just traditional class positions that students can fill each year. Students feel empowered to identify their own leadership opportunities. Students discover that leadership is about finding their voice, mobilizing others, humility, and working hard, among other things, and that these are skills that will set them up for a life of positive impact. St. Margaret\u2019s students do not sit passively, but rather demonstrate their character and actively seek ways to better themselves, our school community and beyond. Leadership opportunities are abundant across all divisions and are developmentally paced for increasing responsibility, decision-making and voice. Students practice and demonstrate leadership in deliberate and meaningful ways as they move through the divisions from Preschool to Upper School. They learn citizenship in the Preschool and understand the importance of helping a friend and being fair, rise to the opportunity to be big buddy in Lower School, create a student club in the Middle School or offer a powerful address on an important topic in Upper School Convocation and organize support around it. St. Margaret\u2019s students respond to issues and needs, and they engage with one another with respect and admiration and distinguish themselves among their peers and beyond the St. Margaret\u2019s campus.

Our community believes that an essential outcome of St. Margaret\u2019s education is that students and graduates feel the compassion, responsibility and calling to serve others and be active and contributing citizens within their communities and the world. Our Episcopal identity guides our service learning program that aims to create understanding of community issues and challenges, engender empathy for others, nurture deeper connections and engagement, build cultural competency and life skills. Service learning and begins with developmentally-appropriate activities in the Early School and builds through the Upper School years. Service learning at St. Margaret's is experiential and requires students to understand the authentic needs of the community they are serving. Often service learning is tied to the content of our academic curriculum, making the service even more relevant and deepening the learning experience in a real setting. We emphasize and model the importance of service by purposefully taking time in the school day within all divisions and as an all-school community for service learning projects, rather than require students to count service hours accumulated after school or on weekends. St. Margaret\u2019s has formed long-term partnerships with local non-profit organizations and leverages these sustained relationships to further their missions within the communities they serve, and to provide powerful learning experiences for our students. Partner organizations include Family Assistance Ministries, The Ecology Center, Operation Help A Hero and the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, Padres Unidos, Second Harvest Food Bank, The Infant Pantry and Welcome INN. The lessons of these kinds of hands-on service experiences leave students with a new understanding of societal issues and inequities; underlining, systemic causes; and deep personal connections to the rewards of investing in and giving back to the community.

Episcopal schools are not solely communities for Christians, rather as ecumenical and diverse ministries of educational and human formation for people of all faiths and backgrounds. Episcopal schools also integrate religious and spiritual formation into the curriculum and life of the school community. Episcopal schools exist not merely to educate, but to demonstrate and proclaim the unique worth and beauty of all human beings. Chapel at St. Margaret's Led by St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School chaplains, Chapel is an integral part of the student experience for every student, nurturing character, grace, community fellowship and spiritual wellness. Every student participates in Chapel services weekly as a dedicated time in the school schedule for proclamation, celebration, solace and reflection of God\u2019s goodness and unconditional love. Chapel services and the Church campus, including the Fountain Courtyard, meditation labyrinth and garden, are sacred and safe spaces always open to students and members of the St. Margaret\u2019s community. Chapel also reinforces the sacred in ourselves and everything around us, and encourages taking time to pause, reflect and appreciate personal truth and life\u2019s authentic joys. It develops mindfulness and a deeper connection with individual spirituality and respect and care for others. The student body and professional community of each division gather as a community for Chapel as a part of the weekly schedule\u2014Early Childhood School gathers weekly, Lower School begins Monday through Thursday with Chapel, Middle School gathers twice a week and Upper School once a week. Readings, prayers and homilies are thoughtfully selected and developed by the chaplains to reflect life and the multiple faiths within the school community. Students have leadership opportunities to serve as acolytes or readers, and offer a homily that reflects upon the reading, and musical or dance performances. Through the tradition of Chapel, students also learn and practice the proper respect and decorum of a sacred space and learn to appreciate its place and value in their lives.

Each student is assigned an advisor, with Middle School students getting a new advisor each school year, while Upper School students keep the same advisor for four years beginning in grade 9. Students view their advisor as a mentor, a personal cheerleader, or someone who could guide them if a challenge arises. The school views the advisor as the person on campus who knows and best cares for each student and will be a trusted counselor and supporter. Advisory groups meet weekly to discuss current adolescent topics and social issues, reflect on guest speakers and school topics, perform service-learning projects, guide academic progress, and to simply connect with one another. The advisory groups become a constant, tight-knit, school family for each student. The advisory structure also provides a framework for students to be involved in Chapel, school-wide events, and retreats both on and off campus. Advisors seek to know the students beyond the classroom, and serve as a liaison for their parents, teachers, coaches and administrators to work together for the benefit of the student.

The Annual Fund is the primary charitable vehicle for the St. Margaret\u2019s community to provide resources that are put to work immediately to support the school, our faculty, and our students. Your gift to the school supports every critical area and every program we offer. Why the Annual Fund? As the most important annual fundraising priority, the Annual Fund provides immediate resources needed for the academic year that cannot be found elsewhere. The Annual Fund is one of the school\u2019s primary sources of operating income and as such ensures the strength and success of our programs. Through St. Margaret\u2019s history, our families have been the ones who made the greatest difference by investing their time to build our community and their treasure to build our school. Each generation of Tartans benefits from this legacy of generosity. We believe in 100% parental investment at all levels \u2013 including philanthropy \u2013 and each year, we ask all families to give to the school through the Annual Fund. How much each family contributes is a personal decision. Gifts typically range from $25 to $25,000 \u2013 a wide range that underscores the importance of each gift that results from the generous nature of our community. All gifts are greatly appreciated and each makes an impact on our students\u2019 experience at St. Margaret\u2019s. The only gift too small is no gift at all! List of 11 frequently asked questions. What is the Annual Fund? The Annual Fund, St. Margaret\u2019s annual giving program, supports nearly every aspect of a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Participation in this program at any level demonstrates our community\u2019s belief in our school\u2019s commitment to preparing students and fulfilling its mission. In fact, the strength of St. Margaret\u2019s and its programs is a direct result of the collective effort of alumni, parents, faculty, staff and friends who participate every year in the Annual Fund. The Annual Fund provides immediate, flexible resources to help fund the school\u2019s highest priorities \u2013technology, sports, visual and performing arts, financial aid, faculty support, campus renewal, etc. Can Annual Fund gifts be restricted? Unrestricted gifts to the Annual Fund are strongly encouraged, as they allow us to direct resources to the areas of greatest need or in response to a special opportunity. Gifts to the Annual Fund may be restricted only if they cover an existing operating expense in a board approved budget. St. Margaret\u2019s has designated ten areas of donor opportunities as follows: \u00b7 General School Opportunities \u00b7 Early Childhood School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Lower School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Middle School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Upper School Classroom Costs \u00b7 Educational Support Services \u00b7 School Administration \u00b7 Facility Costs \u00b7 Financial Aid \u00b7 Arts and Athletics Why is it important to have a high percentage of families participating in the Annual Fund? Participation is the most important part of the Annual Fund. Every participating family makes a difference. When foundations and corporations consider schools for grants, one of their first questions is the percentage of families that contribute to the Annual Fund. Your Annual Fund support is a quantifiable measure of the \u201chealth\u201d of the school, and organizations use this measurement, among others, to decide whether St. Margaret\u2019s is a good investment. With more than 8,000 preschool through Grade 12 independent day schools in the United States, your participation helps to make St. Margaret\u2019s an outstanding choice for grants from foundations and corporations. I already pay a lot for tuition. Why do I need to also give to the Annual Fund? The Annual Fund helps keep tuition fees from increasing too drastically or at all. Without support to the Annual Fund, tuition may have to be greatly increased and/or certain programs and extracurricular student activities may need to be cut. The Annual Fund is an additional investment in the education of each child at St. Margaret\u2019s and an important source of revenue to guarantee the financial health of the school. How much should I give? If we were to answer in dollars, the answer is different for each family. Reflect for a moment on the importance to each student of her or his experiences at St. Margaret\u2019s. Our school as it is today: the high educational standards, the strength of our arts, athletics and clubs, the state-of-the-art science equipment and classroom smart boards, has been made possible by more than two decades of charitable gifts received from the current and past generosity of current and former parents, parents of alumni, grandparents, trustees, and friends. So when it comes to deciding how much to give, we ask that you consider the importance you place on the tangibles listed above, the education your child receives thanks to Annual Fund support, and your family\u2019s circumstances. We ask that you consider giving generously based on all of these. Please remember: every gift makes a difference. I prefer to give later in the year. Why should I pledge my support in the fall? Annual Fund contributions directly affect our operating budget. We regularly reevaluate our budget and make adjustments if funding is not on track. A pledge is a commitment to make a gift. By letting us know in the fall that we can count on your support this year, we can budget accordingly and ensure that all of our programs and activities are fully funded. Pledges can be paid any time before the end of our fiscal year on June 30. How does the Annual Fund benefit my child? Every child at St. Margaret's Episcopal School benefits directly from the gifts made to the annual fund. Whether the funds are spent on enrichment, extracurricular activities, advanced learning opportunities, or information technology, the Annual Fund allows us to provide the finest education for each and every student at St. Margaret's \u2013 from Early Childhood School through Grade 12. Remember that you are making a charitable contribution and that your gift is tax deductible as allowed by law. What is the best way to make a gift to the Annual Fund? There are many options for making your gift: \u00b7 You may make a secure credit card donation online at smes.org/annual-fund. \u00b7 Checks made out to St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School can be mailed to the advancement office, Attention \u201cAnnual Fund,\u201d at 31641 La Novia, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675. \u00b7 You can make a gift stock (please contact the advancement office or visit smes.org/giving for information on the transfer of stock). \u00b7 Many companies also provide matching gift programs for employees who make charitable gifts. When you make a gift to the Annual Fund, check to see if there is a matching gift program at your workplace that can additionally benefit the school. Is my gift tax-deductible? Yes! Your gift to the Annual Fund is tax deductible to the extent allowed by law. You will receive a letter thanking you and acknowledging your gift, which can be used as a receipt for tax purposes. I volunteer a lot of time at St. Margaret's. Doesn't that matter as much as giving money? St. Margaret\u2019s relies heavily on its parent volunteers to help with virtually every aspect of our school. From board members and classroom volunteers to PTF members and hot lunch volunteers, you play a critical role in the life of our school. Your financial support is another important venue to make a significant impact on the life of the school and the future of the children at St. Margaret\u2019s. Does the Annual Fund support ___________? Yes! The Annual Fund supports every area at St. Margaret\u2019s \u2013 the ones most important to you and your children, and those you may have not really thought about. Every aspect of our program is important to the development of the whole child \u2013 our annual fund is designed to support it all, so we can provide opportunities for all. Give Now!

The Annual Fund directly impacts every aspect of the school and each student\u2019s experience. It provides for the margin of excellence in all that we do. The school depends on the Annual Fund to contribute approximately 4% of the operating budget, which translates to $1.35 million this school year.

Every student benefits from the Annual Fund. Community support for the Annual Fund reflects the strong culture of philanthropy at our school.

TALE ensures that all current and future Tartans needing financial support can have the gift of a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, the goal is to grow TALE to the point that every Tartan\u2019s demonstrated need is perpetually met. Give to TALE Alumni Giving FAQ List of 8 frequently asked questions. What is TALE? TALE supports St. Margaret\u2019s Financial Aid program for current and future Tartans. It is the only endowment fund at St. Margaret\u2019s that is both driven by alumni and solely focused on helping fund financial aid. Ultimately, the goal is to have TALE serve as St. Margaret\u2019s primary source of financial aid funding, ensuring that all students can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of their financial background. How much each alumnus contributes is a personal decision. Alumni have historically given $1 to $5,000. However, each gift makes a difference, regardless of its size, and every generation of Tartan will benefit from your generosity. Who benefits from TALE? St. Margaret\u2019s provides financial aid to more than 150 Tartans each year, totaling ~$5 million. These Tartans are an integral part of our community, and are involved with athletics, the arts, student government, and so much more. Without these students, our school would not be the place that we all grew to love. TALE supports financial aid for these students, partially funding the aid packages needed for these Tartans to receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, TALE will grow so that it can sustain financial aid demand in perpetuity, ensuring that each Tartan receives an education, regardless of their financial background. What is the vision for TALE? The vision for TALE is that it becomes a self-sustaining fund that fully finances financial aid in perpetuity at St. Margaret\u2019s. In other words, the goal is for TALE to provide enough money such that that every Tartan can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of financial background. As St. Margaret\u2019s grows, the need for financial aid will grow as well. TALE can assist in alleviating these financial pressures placed on the students and St. Margaret\u2019s. Since its inception, TALE has raised over $1 million in permanently restricted funds, with a lifetime return of 8.2%. All gains have been reinvested in the fund for compounding growth to support future Tartans. Yet, TALE will need to keep growing in order to support our students. Consequently, our long-term vision is to grow TALE to ~$50 million over the next decade. TALE works like the majority of endowment funds used by educational institutions. When you donate to TALE, your dollar is invested in a collection of index funds and other assets that create compounding, long-term growth which ultimately generate funds for financial aid in perpetuity. My company has a matching gift program, what does that mean? Many companies offer as a benefit to their employees the opportunity to \u201cmatch\u201d your charitable contribution to your chosen charity or non-profit. You can utilize a matching gift through your work to surpass the leadership donor mark of $2,500 \u2013 meaning you can contribute $1,250 annually (roughly $100/month) and your company will contribute the balance to make you a leadership donor! To see if your company has program contact your Human Resources Office or contact alumni@smes.org for assistance. Can I make my gift through stocks? Alumni can make gifts multiple ways \u2013 cash, credit card, and also through stock transfers. To do so contact alumni@smes.org for all the details on how to make your gift. Can I name St. Margaret\u2019s as a beneficiary on my 401k at work or in my estate plan? Certainly. By doing so you\u2019ll become part of the Ernest D. Sillers Legacy Society . Named after Fr. Sillers, it was established to recognize those whose commitment to St. Margaret\u2019s extends well into the future. Contact Jonathan Tufo to notify us for proper recognition. Can I volunteer to serve on the Tartan Alumni Council's Endowment Committee? Certainly! We love alumni volunteers. If you have a passion for encouraging your peers to philanthropically give back to your alma mater, this might be a great volunteer fit for you! Please contact alumni@smes.org to express your interest. Do you take Venmo? Yes! Make your gift easy and just Venmo us @TartanAlumni. Be sure to include your name, class year, and the word \u201cTALE\u201d in your message! TALE Giving Levels List of 7 items.

For the first time, the Upper School will be offering week-long, interdisciplinary courses in the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences.

These experiential courses, while not for credit, will inspire curiosity and ignite new passions, while also helping students to distinguish themselves as scholars and practitioners of the arts, humanities, sciences, or social sciences.

Click Here to Register! Register now! The St. Margaret\u2019s Summer Institute will return on June 13-14, 2025 at St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School in beautiful San Juan Capistrano, California. This summer, we are inviting educators from all grade levels\u2014preschool through high school\u2014to join us for a transformative, hands-on professional development experience grounded in constructivist theory, place-based learning, and transdisciplinary approaches. While set in the beautiful coastal environment of California, the learning is designed to transcend location, allowing teachers to bring these powerful principles back to their classrooms no matter where they teach. On Friday, June 13, choose from one of three immersive workshops, each rooted in the idea that students learn best by doing, reflecting, and connecting their learning to the world around them. Each workshop is designed to foster active, inquiry-based, and student-centered learning that aligns with constructivist theory\u2014where knowledge is built through experiences and active engagement. The workshops include: Into the Blue: Embracing Challenge and Self-Discovery Through Ocean-Based Learning: In this immersive workshop, you'll explore the transformative power of risk, challenge, and reflection, using the ocean as a dynamic classroom. Together we will engage in hands-on activities like wave science and reflection through journaling and photography. You will read memoirs blending surfing, struggle, and self-discovery, deepening your understanding of how personal narrative and place-based learning intersect. This workshop models a student-centered approach that connects heart, mind, and body. Oceans of Wonder: Perception, Place, and the Natural World: Explore the natural world through both scientific inquiry and artistic expression. By immersing yourself in the local ecosystem, you'll discover how to help your students develop a deep connection to their environment and encourage them to observe, question, and reflect on the world around them. This workshop blends scientific inquiry (biology, ecology, environmental science) and art (sketching, journaling, photography) to promote holistic, hands-on learning\u2014an essential component of constructivism. Waves of Belonging: Surfing, Subjectivity, and Stories: This workshop will take you into the heart of California's surf culture, where you'll explore how identity, community, and personal stories shape our understanding of a place. Through storytelling, history, and the cultural significance of surf culture, you\u2019ll learn how to help students reflect on their own identities while connecting to the broader world through place-based learning. This is an example of how constructivist learning helps students create personal meaning and understanding through experience and reflection. On Saturday, June 14 we will gather for a keynote speaker, a day of reflection and application with fellow educators to discuss your experiences and explore how to bring these constructivist, place-based, and transdisciplinary learning strategies into your own classroom. The day will finish with a panel session. Attendees will leave the St. Margaret\u2019s Summer Institute with practical tools, strategies, and a fresh perspective on how to create meaningful, student-centered learning environments that encourage inquiry, reflection, and connection to the world. Whether you\u2019re teaching in California or anywhere else, you\u2019ll be ready to inspire your students with new approaches to learning that nurture curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. 2024 Recap St. Margaret's played host to early childhood educators, administrators and policy makers at the inaugural 2024 Summer Institute.

During the 2023-2024 school year, the Board of Trustees determined it was the appropriate time to create a new Strategic Plan for the future of St. Margaret's. As part of this process, the Board of Trustees and Head of School created a Strategic Plan Steering Committee and engaged Ian Symmonds of Ian Symmonds & Associates to serve as a consultant. During the 2024-2025 school year, the committee will work with Mr. Symmonds and his team to collect qualitative and quantitative input from all of the school\u2019s constituencies, including parents, students, alumni and parents of alumni, professional community, and the Board of Trustees. This page will serve as a comprehensive and transparent resource around this important work, and we encourage you to take some time to learn more the strategic planning process at St. Margaret\u2019s, including the timeline, feedback mechanisms and the makeup of the steering committee. As this process unfolds, we invite you to take the opportunity to let your voice be heard, as together we chart the course for the next generation of Tartans. Sincerely, Dana Sullivan President, Board of Trustees Dr. Jeneen Graham Head of School The Board of Trustees and Head of School has engaged Ian Symmonds of Ian Symmonds & Associates to serve as a consultant for the Strategic Planning process. Ian is an author, speaker, ed-activist, and strategist. His global professional practice as a senior officer, executive director, and dean spanned Pacific University, Culver-Stockton College, Saint Mary\u2019s Hall, and Trinity University.

Through experiences in the visual arts, music, dance, theater and technical arts, students discover and nurture the artists within. As students from Early Childhood School through Upper School are introduced to the fundamentals of the art forms, they learn how to learn. An arts education at St. Margaret's develops 21st Century Learning Skills, supports all core subjects, creates empathy, builds bridges and helps develop voice and vision. The arts are thriving at St. Margaret's. Through many artistic endeavors, students celebrate their own work and the work of their peers and their artistic experiences connect them to generations of artists and audiences. The transforming power of the arts is vividly experienced as students explore their talents as playwrights, directors, actors, technical crew members, costume and make up designers, graphic designers, filmmakers, studio artists, photographers, choreographers, composers, literary artists and more. As the artists' skills increase through practice, they become comfortable in viewing their - and others' - work in the arts as a journey, not as a destination. The St. Margaret's arts faculty consists of dedicated professional arts educators, all of whom maintain an active professional life in the arts in addition to their work with our students.

TALE ensures that all current and future Tartans needing financial support can have the gift of a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, the goal is to grow TALE to the point that every Tartan\u2019s demonstrated need is perpetually met. Give to TALE Alumni Giving FAQ List of 8 frequently asked questions. What is TALE? TALE supports St. Margaret\u2019s Financial Aid program for current and future Tartans. It is the only endowment fund at St. Margaret\u2019s that is both driven by alumni and solely focused on helping fund financial aid. Ultimately, the goal is to have TALE serve as St. Margaret\u2019s primary source of financial aid funding, ensuring that all students can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of their financial background. How much each alumnus contributes is a personal decision. Alumni have historically given $1 to $5,000. However, each gift makes a difference, regardless of its size, and every generation of Tartan will benefit from your generosity. Who benefits from TALE? St. Margaret\u2019s provides financial aid to more than 150 Tartans each year, totaling ~$5 million. These Tartans are an integral part of our community, and are involved with athletics, the arts, student government, and so much more. Without these students, our school would not be the place that we all grew to love. TALE supports financial aid for these students, partially funding the aid packages needed for these Tartans to receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Ultimately, TALE will grow so that it can sustain financial aid demand in perpetuity, ensuring that each Tartan receives an education, regardless of their financial background. What is the vision for TALE? The vision for TALE is that it becomes a self-sustaining fund that fully finances financial aid in perpetuity at St. Margaret\u2019s. In other words, the goal is for TALE to provide enough money such that that every Tartan can receive a St. Margaret\u2019s education regardless of financial background. As St. Margaret\u2019s grows, the need for financial aid will grow as well. TALE can assist in alleviating these financial pressures placed on the students and St. Margaret\u2019s. Since its inception, TALE has raised over $1 million in permanently restricted funds, with a lifetime return of 8.2%. All gains have been reinvested in the fund for compounding growth to support future Tartans. Yet, TALE will need to keep growing in order to support our students. Consequently, our long-term vision is to grow TALE to ~$50 million over the next decade. TALE works like the majority of endowment funds used by educational institutions. When you donate to TALE, your dollar is invested in a collection of index funds and other assets that create compounding, long-term growth which ultimately generate funds for financial aid in perpetuity. My company has a matching gift program, what does that mean? Many companies offer as a benefit to their employees the opportunity to \u201cmatch\u201d your charitable contribution to your chosen charity or non-profit. You can utilize a matching gift through your work to surpass the leadership donor mark of $2,500 \u2013 meaning you can contribute $1,250 annually (roughly $100/month) and your company will contribute the balance to make you a leadership donor! To see if your company has program contact your Human Resources Office or contact alumni@smes.org for assistance. Can I make my gift through stocks? Alumni can make gifts multiple ways \u2013 cash, credit card, and also through stock transfers. To do so contact alumni@smes.org for all the details on how to make your gift. Can I name St. Margaret\u2019s as a beneficiary on my 401k at work or in my estate plan? Certainly. By doing so you\u2019ll become part of the Ernest D. Sillers Legacy Society . Named after Fr. Sillers, it was established to recognize those whose commitment to St. Margaret\u2019s extends well into the future. Contact Jonathan Tufo to notify us for proper recognition. Can I volunteer to serve on the Tartan Alumni Council's Endowment Committee? Certainly! We love alumni volunteers. If you have a passion for encouraging your peers to philanthropically give back to your alma mater, this might be a great volunteer fit for you! Please contact alumni@smes.org to express your interest. Do you take Venmo? Yes! Make your gift easy and just Venmo us @TartanAlumni.

These gifts require planning and, often, help from your professional advisors. Unlike cash donations, these gifts are typically made from assets in your estate rather than disposable income. There are myriad vehicles through which you can make a planned gift. When choosing a vehicle to make a gift, we ask that you consider your financial goals. There are gifts that help you protect your assets, gifts that generate income for you, and gifts that are very simple and only require a provision in your will or trust. Whether you are in your mid 30s and in the building stage of your life, or nearing retirement and considering your legacy, there is a planned gift that suits your needs and can help you meet your goals. The most common planned gifts include bequests, life insurance, trusts and annuities, retirement and pension plans, charitable IRA rollovers, and real estate. We welcome your questions and the opportunity to help you secure your family\u2019s future while making an investment in the future of St. Margaret\u2019s. Please consult with your attorney or our Director of Advancement to ensure that your bequest best achieves your desired result.

As a subject area specialist, the chair leads the department in curricular reviews to vertically and horizontally align curriculum in grades 4 through 12. Department chairs are responsible for developing new courses and staying on the leading edge of content and pedagogy within the discipline. As lead teachers, department chairs guide department faculty in department goals, planning, and discussions, and provide professional development opportunities that reflect promising practices in instruction within each discipline. All student assessment data, both local and nationally normed, is reviewed by the department chairs in an effort to ameliorate weaknesses and celebrate strengths. Decisions about acceleration, typically in the form of honors and Advanced Placement courses, are made by department chairs. List of 10 items. Computer Science The St. Margaret\u2019s community is empowered by emerging technologies without boundaries, transcending traditional approaches to teaching and learning. Using the design thinking model, we promote experiential, collaborative and creative learning in order to demystify the complexities often associated with technology.

English The English Department seeks to develop in each student the ability to write clear and persuasive prose, the skills required to read and interpret literature, and the power to make full use of written and spoken language. We are consistent in our use of the process approach to writing. We help students put their written work through a thoughtful and often time-consuming process of drafting and revision. Through repeated emphasis on critical thinking and writing, students encounter both themselves and differing voices in small group environments that encourage discussion. Through the study of literature, students experience diversity in voice and develop empathy for the alternative narratives of the human experience. In the end, the study of literature invites the ongoing questions: who am I in the world, and what does it mean to be human? The English Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Master the processes of reading, writing, and speaking Analyze texts, interpret, and read for subtexts, hidden meanings, and paradoxes Develop the art of communication and personal expression Read actively and connect to previous knowledge and experience Understand one\u2019s own process of learning Empathize with the stories of others and alternative narratives of human expression Discover and develop insight and personal identity through literature Think critically History & Social Science The History Department believes that knowledge of the past is necessary to comprehend the present and to forge the future thoughtfully and deliberately. We foster the sheer enjoyment of the adventure of historical discovery and study, seeing ourselves in the present as interconnected with people of the past \u2013 our families, fellow citizens and humanity around the globe. Through the study of history, students will learn foundational content, think carefully and precisely, interpret bias, and articulate thinking in oral and written form. Research of primary documents will foster critical readers who are able to analyze and synthesize data in order to develop and prove a thesis. Small discussion groups and writing workshops help our students to develop an awareness of oneself with the ability to respect, understand, and appreciate differences. In our work as historians, we develop the requisite skills to embrace purposefully life\u2019s journey and challenges as we learn to understand ourselves and humanity. The History Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions including ways to: Learn facts, think carefully and precisely, and articulate thinking in oral and written form Conduct research: inquire thoughtfully, read critically, analyze and synthesize data, document findings, format a paper Create and prove a thesis Develop an awareness of oneself and be able to express oneself confidently, while understanding the dangers of ethnocentrism and egocentrism Empathize and respect differences in individuals, communities, religions, values, and cultures of the past, present, and future Take responsibility for cultivating individual character and formation as lifelong learners Mathematics It is the belief of the Mathematics Department at St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School that mathematics is not an isolated discipline, but rather a necessary tool for understanding many other fields in a rapidly evolving world. While we value the mastery of skills and computational techniques, we stress the understanding of concepts and the significance of results. Our instructors create a supportive learning community that encourages collaboration both in and out of the classroom. We motivate our students to persevere through the challenges inherent in a rigorous study of mathematics. We offer an innovative and dynamic environment for the development of mathematics, which is essential for success in an increasingly technological world.

Through experiences in Dance, Music, and Theater, students discover and nurture the artist within. As students are introduced to the fundamentals of an art form, they learn how to learn. As their skill increases through practice, they become comfortable viewing their own work - as well as the work of others - as a journey, not a destination. We believe that the power of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As members of ensembles, students celebrate their own work and the work of their peers. The transforming power of the Arts is vividly experienced as students become conduits, connecting their humanity to generations of artists and audiences. The Performing Arts Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Learn and apply fundamentals skills and techniques such as the reading of music. Understand art as humanity\u2014helps us experience who we are and remember others before us. Appreciate art as a creative and critical process. Experience art as a powerful form of personal communication and expression. Personal Fitness and Wellness The philosophy of the Personal Fitness and Wellness Department is based on the belief that an individual\u2019s physical, social and emotional development is as important as their academic growth. The curriculum is designed to provide students with the skills necessary to build a foundation of comprehensive wellness by learning to create and analyze individualized plans. The classes incorporate personal goal setting, exercise physiology, strength training, cardiovascular training, mindfulness, yoga, and interdependent thinking to promote lifelong patterns of healthy behavior. The Personal Fitness and Wellness Department seeks to impart to its students through its curriculum an enduring understanding of specific knowledge, principles, and learning dispositions such as: Establish habits for lifelong fitness, well-being and mindfulness Provide character education and personal development opportunities: challenge one\u2019s personal limits and express care and appreciation for others Participate as a member of a team, acquire leadership abilities, understand good citizenship and friendly competition Develop kinesthetic, coordination, and loco-motor skills to play and live actively Instill a love of game; play and sport from both a spectator and participant perspective Religion and Philosophy The Religion and Philosophy Department believes that all people are made in the image of God. Our goal as an Episcopal School is to nurture the spiritual development of each person, to welcome everyone into our community, and to seek Jesus Christ in all people, loving our neighbors as ourselves. We seek to live examined lives and explore faith by asking questions, encouraging spirited debate, and instilling a sense of wonder. Through religion classes we develop a deeper understanding of the basic tenants of Christian faith and how course material can help us in everyday life. Exploration of other world religions and philosophies encourages students to understand similarities and differences and the role that faith and religion plays in other countries and cultures. Science The Science Department believes that science is a process rooted in curiosity, awe, understanding and respect for the natural world in which we live. Students are encouraged to become autonomous learners in a collaborative environment. We teach students to be critical thinkers who use logic, experimental design, and problem solving as vehicles for discovery. Through a carefully constructed curriculum, our students develop scientific literacy, understand the research process, and hone effective communication skills. We apply the scientific method throughout a student\u2019s experience at St. Margaret\u2019s and empower budding scientists to formulate interesting questions, develop a hypothesis, design an experiment, analyze results, and report a thoughtful conclusion. Our students learn to think logically and critically and to transfer scientific knowledge and skills to other disciplines. It is our hope that students will mature into responsible stewards of the Earth and build lifelong interest in science.

Ongoing assessment of children\u2019s progress includes the gathering of anecdotal records, digital photographs, developmental checklists and work samples. Annual speech, hearing and vision screenings in the fall and the results of nationally normed developmental screenings (fall and spring) are added to the child\u2019s portfolio to share with parents at two formal conferences each year. Parents also have an opportunity to participate in assessing their child\u2019s development with a parent-report developmental screen, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. All this information gives us a picture of a child\u2019s development and alerts us if more information and support is needed to help a child reach his or her potential. The St. Margaret\u2019s Early School plans curriculum to support all areas of a child\u2019s development: cognitive, social, emotional, physical and creative. Our curriculum meets or exceeds the California Preschool Learning Foundations, aligns with goals for young children\u2019s learning from the National Association for the Education of Young Children and serves as the foundation for the St. Margaret\u2019s kindergarten curriculum. Learning in preschool is hands-on and integrated. A child\u2019s time outside chasing insects in the garden, for instance, incorporates all the \u201cdispositions for learning\u201d as well as cognitive development: science (\u201cWhat kind of bug is this?\u201d \u201cWhat do they eat?\u201d); math (\u201cIs it larger or smaller than the other one?\u201d \u201cHow many did you find today?\u201d); language (\u201cMonarch Butterflies are orange and black.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s make up a poem about butterflies!\u201d); social skills (\u201cHow can we all see?\u201d \u201cYou can have a turn next.\u201d); physical development (running after the butterfly, carefully stepping around plants, manipulating the butterfly net); and creative (painting a picture of the butterfly in its habitat. Dancing and moving like one.) Learning is everywhere and happening all the time supported by teachers skilled at looking for and creating moments of discovery and learning based on children\u2019s needs and interests. List of 8 items. Art St. Margaret\u2019s Early School offers creative art experiences for children daily in the classroom and Atelier (art studio). Children explore and create using a variety of drawing tools, paints, clay, paper, wire, loose parts, natural items and more. By having art materials available everyday, children gain competence with them and are likely to use them in new and more sophisticated ways. Classroom teachers work closely with the Atelierista (art studio teacher) to extend children\u2019s thinking in the Atelier. The Atelier is a place where children are both artists and scientists as they engage with traditional art materials alongside technology to investigate the natural world, express their ideas, and formulate new questions to further their inquiry. Engaging in art as an expressive language as well as a form in inquiry cultivates and strengthens persistence, creativity, problem solving, and flexibility. It also supports children\u2019s understanding of spatial relationships and physics, perspective and proportion, as well as strengthens development in areas such as fine motor dexterity. From using a digital microscope to look at a flower more closely, to creating a sculpture from clay to be fired in our kiln, the children are offered a wide array of experiences, building a foundation for future art and science thinking. Physical Development We plan fine and gross motor activities each day both inside and outside. St. Margaret\u2019s has a full-time Perceptual Motor Specialist who sets up motor experiences that stimulate the body systems to gain strength, balance and coordination. Activities are planned to meet children\u2019s needs based on observations, collaboration with classroom teachers and developmental assessments . Activities such as using eye droppers and squeeze bottles to water plants, manipulating art materials to create a masterpiece, pouring and measuring for cooking activities and playing with playhouse people are the foundation skills that build strength in muscles used for writing. Through motor activities the children will: Gain confidence and good body image Learn to control eye-hand coordination Develop fine motor dexterity and control as a foundation for writing Demonstrate balance and control during loco-motor movements Use muscles to manipulate objects and control environment Dramatic Play/Drama Children don\u2019t need much encouragement to pretend and engage in dramatic play. It is second nature to them. They\u2019ll create it in the playhouse (in or outside) in the sandbox, with unit blocks and animals and people inside, with the hollow blocks and hard hats outside, on bikes, in the garden... everywhere! In dramatic play, the children will: Use their creativity and imagination Work out fears and worries Sort through their understandings of fantasy and reality Try on roles, learn about their world Enhance vocabulary and receptive (listening) and expressive (speaking) language skills Gain the ability to plan, organize & clean up! Develop focus and concentration Practice self-regulation and problem-solving Explore concepts of \u201cfair\u201d and practice turn-taking, cooperation and sharing Use symbolic thought Retell and reenact events in stories Language & Literacy Books (story books, non-fiction or poetry) are read to children each day at group time and one-on-one throughout the day both inside and outside. Children have flannel board stories to retell favorites or create their own. Children make individual or class books to document experiences and celebrate the imagination. We provide children with opportunities for meaningful conversations with us and each other throughout the day. Through dramatic play, table top games, group time activities and casual conversations with teachers and each other, the children will: Practice listening, asking and responding to questions Be encouraged to express ideas, develop age-appropriate grammar and learn new vocabulary Develop phonemic and phonological awareness by: playing with the sounds of words, matching sounds and rhymes, clapping out syllables, predicting story outcomes Identify the alphabet as a special category of symbols Recognize beginning letters in familiar words and associate letters with sounds Discover that letters make up words and words make up sentences Begin to think of themselves as authors by beginning to understand that books are \u201ctalk written down\u201d, Listen to and make up their own stories and poems Enjoy representing their own ideas through drawing or dictation Experiment with writing to communicate ideas, including writing their name Move along the reading continuum Mathematics Math is everywhere\u2014inside and outside. Children love to count and compare things. Through blocks, science and nature activities, dramatic play, art, music and movement the children will build foundation skills in arithmetic, geometry and algebra. The children will: Show 1-to-1 correspondence as part of counting and numeracy skills 0-9 Understand and demonstrate concepts of more and less Demonstrate understanding of sets and ordering (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) Recognize and manipulate basic shapes and discover spatial relationships Classify and sort by attributes (color, size, shape) Extend and create patterns Learn by making estimations and graphs Experiment with measurement (standard and unconventional) Learn and have fun! Music The St. Margaret\u2019s Early School music program strives to nurture a joy of music making in students and to foster an appreciation of natural and found sounds in our students\u2019 environments. Students are introduced to the rudiments of melody, harmony, and rhythm; central tenements to building a solid foundation in music appreciation and music making. Learning Objectives : Melody: Learning about call and response patterns Recognition of symbols and how they are used to notate and form melodic patterns Learning about high sounds and low sounds Differentiating between loud sounds and soft sounds Encouraging students to create their own melodies and recognize that melodies can be found anywhere. Listening to different types of melodies from different parts of the world. Harmony: Helping students to recognize and describe the experience of putting different sounds together. Learning to sing in rounds Encouraging students to experiment with superimposing melodies onto one another and describing the sounds through artwork or physical expression. Listening to how different musical mediums (i.e. brass quartet versus choral singing) present different types of harmonies. Rhythm: Learning to recognize \u201cfeeling the beat\u201d in music and what that makes our bodies feel. Having children play in instrument or drum circles to encourage collective improvisation, performance leadership, and artistic confidence. Introduction of basic rhythmic nomenclature: quarter note (ta), half note (ta-ah), eighth notes (ta-ka), and rests (beats of silence). Encouraging students to write their own rhythms using their own musical language. Dancing to different types of rhythms from different parts of the world. Learning different tempo markings; different fast and slow sounds. Instructional Methods : Direct whole group instruction in our outdoor classroom. Using different instruments to demonstrate different sounds and concepts. Digital, video, and sound presentations Having open discussions with students about digital, video, and sound presentations. Guiding students to develop their own personal, creative tools and vocabulary to share their artistic expression. Encouraging the physical manifestations of what music makes our bodies feel. Encouraging students to embrace the joy of collaborative and collective music making. Making field trips to the St. Margaret\u2019s Performing Arts Center (PAC) and engaging with the varying music and performing arts disciplines (i.e. orchestra, band, choir) Engaging parents in talking about music at home by giving students mini music activities they can do at home with their parents Can you create a cooking dinner with dad playlist? What sound effects or little music jingles can you and mom create while reading your bed time story(ies)? Will your siblings help you and your stuffed animals create a puppet show at home with sound effects and self-composed music? Inviting guest artists and teachers to showcase different mediums of music making.

Our graduates are independent thinkers of integrity and compassion who reveal their resilience and collaborative nature in the face of challenge and opportunity. Core Values List of 5 items.

St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs. Episcopal Identity St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School is upheld by the basic principles of our Episcopal tenets that individuals and institutions are called to strive for justice and peace among all people, and to respect the dignity of every human being. Episcopal schools are not solely communities for Christians, rather as ecumenical and diverse ministries of educational and human formation for people of all faiths and backgrounds. Episcopal schools also integrate religious and spiritual formation into the curriculum and life of the school community. Episcopal schools exist not merely to educate, but to demonstrate and proclaim the unique worth and beauty of all human beings. As an Episcopal School we uphold our Statement of Faith in carrying out the important work of our mission. Our tradition appreciates the mystery and breadth of God\u2019s love and inspires debate, welcomes diverse ideas, values ambiguity and paradox, and respects traditions other than those set out in the Book of Common Prayer, the basis for corporate worship in the Episcopal Church. We affirm the right of each child and each member of our community to follow spiritual paths free from coercion\u2014paths open to discussion and inquiry that are respectful of the Episcopal tradition and of differing views. From Early Childhood School through Upper School, opportunities for spiritual learning, worship, prayer, reflection, and participation in the Eucharist are offered and comprise a foundation for all students to recognize the importance of their own spirituality and the critical value of acceptance and understanding among people of different faiths. The vision of our founding headmaster, The Reverend Canon Ernest D. Sillers, continues to guide us today, \u201cEvery student is a sacred and precious child of God, endowed with the potential to become a productive, contributing member of society. Our purpose is to prepare students for life in a complex society, beset with grave problems and great pressures, by providing a strong program in character development and teaching morals undergirded with basic Judeo-Christian values.\u201d We seek to prepare future leaders of conviction and perspective who can appreciate the powerful, positive role that inclusivity and understanding can have on the future direction of human kind. We expect our students to strive for justice and peace among all peoples, and respect the dignity of every human being.* As a result, we expect our students to be contributing members of our school community and the world beyond. From the Baptismal Covenant of the Book of Common Prayer* We are fortunate to be identified as an Episcopal school, not only because this expresses the importance and centrality of God\u2019s grace, love and power in the raising of children, but also because this tradition provides a compass for our navigation through the shifting winds of change so prevalent in our lives today. We strive to act out of love, to teach love, to model love and to love one another in this community. As an Episcopal School, we will always consider God in reviewing our mission and maintaining our course. 26 We realize that some of our graduates may encounter times of uncertainty of their faith and lacking absolute clarity in their lives. In these instances, have we failed them? Our answer is no. We believe that the grounding they acquire here in study, reflection, debate and conscious pursuit of spirituality will serve as an enduring guide and offer consolation in times of doubt and confusion. Our job is to plant seeds that, with God\u2019s help, will flourish in time. To read about our student Chapel program, please click here .

Through many artistic endeavors, students celebrate their own work and the work of their peers and their artistic experiences connect them to generations of artists and audiences. The transforming power of the arts is vividly experienced as students explore their talents as playwrights, directors, actors, technical crew members, costume and make up designers, graphic designers, filmmakers, studio artists, photographers, choreographers, composers, literary artists and more. As the artists' skills increase through practice, they become comfortable in viewing their - and others' - work in the arts as a journey, not as a destination.

Reese Maciariello (\u201929) played the charming Katrina Van Tassel, while Jake Norton (\u201929) portrayed the mischievous Brom Bones, who kept Ichabod on edge with relentless pranks. The story was narrated by a chorus of students who added clever wordplay and wit to each scene.

The Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s presented the Upper School musical, Alice by Heart, in the Marcus D. Hurlbut Theater last week. A talented cast of 22 Upper School students told a reimagined version of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland in this story about resilience, imagination and the power of finding escape in the imaginary worlds we create. This production was set in the depths of World War II in a London tube station. The set design by Gordon Richins, technical director and resident designer, transported audiences to the Underground setting that serves as a makeshift bomb shelter in the story. The refugees in the shelter use storytelling to navigate grief and fear. They escape through their imagination, and into the absurdity of Lewis Carroll\u2019s world filled with nonsense, humor and playful language. According to Daniel Pacheco, director of performing arts and department chair, \u201cThis production has been a journey of exploration \u2013 into the whimsical, the heartbreaking, and the beautifully strange. Our cast and crew of 38 students have worked tirelessly to bring this world to life. It is a reminder that in moments of darkness, we can turn to stories not just to escape, but to heal.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

St. Margaret\u2019s visual arts and performing arts students dazzled the crowd during FrightFEST, an annual Halloween-inspired arts showcase that took place in the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts. The show featured a performance by the Tartan Dance Company, short films created by Upper School cinematic arts students, a photography exhibit, a performance by the Tartan Dance Company, a creative writing competition, and a showcase of ghostly paintings created by Upper School faculty. There was also a live picture orchestral performance of the 1922 film Nosferatu arranged and edited by Karen Bennett and conducted by Linling Hsu featuring the St. Margaret\u2019s orchestra. The collaboration is a way for film and orchestra students to learn about the early days of film and the methods by which early films were screened with music. Students in Ms. Bennett\u2019s film productions honors course took the 90-minute Nosferatu film and edited down to an 18-minute story, in which the orchestra played an arrangement that worked with the short film. The FrightFEST contests for best short story, best photography and best film will be announced next week at Upper School Convo. You can view films and performances from FrightFEST at this link .

The cast of 20 Upper School students brought to life the classic F.S Fitzgerald novel, The Great Gatsby , in the McGregor Theater recently. The four sold-out performances included incredible acting as well as impressive production numbers featuring cast members Sienna Ganem \u201926 as singer Ginevra King and choreography by Paige Minton \u201926. Director of Performing Arts Dan Pacheco said he wanted to transport the audience to the 1920s, an era marked by both opulence and disappointment. \u201cWe hope you feel the vibrant energy of the 1920's and explore how longing for connection, acceptance and a brighter future are very much present-day themes.\u201d Mr. Pacheco worked with costume designer Kirk Stefferud to achieve a splashy, glittery and rich look. Mr. Stefferud was on hand throughout the performances to assist with the numerous costume changes for seamless storytelling. The Mr. Pacheco also selected music that would be approachable to kids currently, including songs by Lady Gaga and Chappell Roan. The songs were accompanied by large dance numbers. According to Paige, \u201cMy choreography acts as a beacon of light, pleasure and fun in a play with a serious, downhearted and sullen theme.\u201d Many technical aspects also worked to tell the story. Lighting design and atmospherics were created by Gavin Shams \u201926 and a running crew under the leadership of stage manager Claire Martin \u201926 and assistant stage manager Tyler Sant \u201928. Because the production included fluid scene changes, the running crew sometimes entered during the action. They decided to wear formal wear, earning them the nickname the \u201cTech-xedos,\u201d which added to the glamour of the show. Technical Director and Resident Designer Gordon Richins and Production Assistant Justice Musick-Corson were pleased with the overall success of the fall production and the hard work of everyone who brought the show to life.

This feature story is an excerpt from the upcoming Highlander Magazine, coming soon! In the heart of the performing arts department, innovation unfolds as a symphony of creativity and education intertwines, crafting an experience that transcends beyond instruction to ignite the joy of learning. Here, amid the harmonious blend of tradition and cutting-edge techniques, a new story takes place\u2014one where students and faculty are empowered to explore, experiment, and embrace the transformative power of the arts. From pioneering productions to cross-divisional collaborations, each endeavor enriches the stage and cultivates a profound passion for knowledge\u2014fostering a community where curiosity and joy thrive, and the pursuit of excellence knows no bounds. In the dimmed ambiance of Hurlbut Theater, the stage springs to life with a harmony of light and sound, transporting the audience into a world where creativity extends into collaboration between disciplines. The realm of performing arts has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years, driven by an infusion of innovative and imaginative elements that redefine experiences. At the recent Spring Orchestra Concert, the audience was left awe-struck as students performed a medley from the movie La La Land. With Orchestra Director Linling Hsu at the helm, the student performers treated attendees to a spectacle in which traditional boundaries between film and a live performance dissolved seamlessly. Clips from the critically acclaimed film interwoven with musical elements created a mesmerizing fusion of mediums that captivated the senses, engaging the audience in a fully immersive experience. Dan Pacheco, St. Margaret\u2019s director of performing arts, praised the collaboration that produced such a successful, innovative concert. \u201cLinling Hsu is extraordinary and has been creating innovative approaches to music education in both formal and informal settings. She came up with the idea to have students in the orchestra play coordinated clips of the film La La Land with a spectacular result!\u201d The collaboration stemmed from an orchestra unit exploring music in films. The lesson aimed to elevate students' musical experience and broaden their understanding of the symbiotic relationship between music and visual media. Drawing inspiration from educational field trips like the Disney Soundtrack Sessions and learning about classical music concerts all over the world that incorporate multimedia in their performances, the students were provided an opportunity to infuse the curriculum with a similar sense of excitement and innovation. Ms. Hsu expressed the joyful experience and the rewards of the collaboration. \u201cAs a teacher, it was immensely gratifying to witness their dedication and growth throughout the process, culminating in a memorable performance that captivated both performers and audience alike,\u201d she said. In essence, the connection with film and music not only enriched students' musical education but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the power of collaboration and creativity. It's a testament to the transformative potential of music education, inspiring faculty and students to continue pushing boundaries and exploring new avenues of artistic expression with a renewed sense of purpose, motivation and wonderment. The cinematic arts department, led by film teacher Karen Bennett, were tasked with synchronizing music and visuals and mapping out musical cues through streamers and punches, essentially a visual click track for the conductor to follow. Through rigorous rehearsals and fine-tuning, orchestra students embraced the challenge of bringing the music of La La Land to life, striving for precision with each rendition. A former Hollywood music editor, Ms. Bennett showcased her experience in creating a tempo map with punches and streamers for Ms. Hsu to use while conducting the orchestra. According to Ms. Bennett the planning of this remarkable innovation required intentionality. \u201cI needed to find clips that would tell the complete story in a much shorter amount of time while also following with the music that was already in place,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this case, we started with the \u2018La La Land Medley\u2019 and then I mapped out the tempo to determine how many bars and beats we needed and where the important moments would happen in the story. I re-cut the film to tell the story while matching the music. At the end we included a drummer who had the audio track in headphones so they could play along with the orchestra.\u201d The integration of cinematic techniques into theatrical performances has been a hallmark of the department's evolution. Students in theater and cinematic arts classes curate spine-chilling tales for the annual FrightFest, leveraging custom-designed projections that envelop the stage in eerie atmospheres. This process involves the creation of digital scenes that are then projected onto the stage, effectively transforming the space into a cinematic canvas. Scrims adorned with dynamic projections transport audiences through enchanted flower fields in Shrek and swirling tornadoes in Wizard of Oz while digitally enlarged characters from Oz interacted with student performers, pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. Beyond visual effects, stagecraft itself has been redefined with daring innovations. The grade 4-5 musical Peter Pan saw performers taking flight on intricate rope swings, while the Middle School musical Matilda displayed performers with suspended swings that nearly reached the audience, encapsulating childhood dreams in a fun spectacle. Harnesses allowed students to soar and defy gravity, executing acrobatic feats that enrich the narrative of each production as seen in the Upper School musical Mary Poppins in which students flew on stage, flipped in the air, and climbed set pieces sideways. Technological advancements extend to lighting design, where St. Margaret's is transitioning to LED technology revolutionizing the department's capabilities. Once limited by manual adjustments, lighting cues now unfold with digital precision, transforming stage ambiance at the touch of a button. The upgrade enables dynamic shifts in color and intensity, enhancing emotional resonance and thematic depth in performances like never before. This shift to LED technology not only improved the efficiency and flexibility of lighting design but also opened up new creative possibilities, allowing for more intricate and immersive lighting experiences. In a recent piece at the spring band concert, Band Director Chris Carbajal conducted with a lightsaber as the band played the Star Wars theme while lights produced images of stars twinkling synchronously in the background, creating a celestial backdrop that mirrored the movie\u2019s ethereal melodies. In another production during The Tartan Revue, a theatrical haze enveloped the stage, evoking the raw energy of a rock concert while amplifying the impact of intricate lighting choreography. As these innovations continue to shape the landscape of performing arts education, the department remains committed to pushing boundaries and nurturing creative excellence. Students are given the opportunity to experiment and explore new ideas, fostering a culture of creativity and innovation. Each production becomes a testament to the transformative power of technology in storytelling, inspiring students to dream bigger and explore new frontiers in the realm of imagination. In the evolving tapestry of the performing arts, innovation is not merely a tool but a joyful catalyst for redefining what is possible. Performing arts is innovative at St. Margaret\u2019s, which enhances production and student learning \u2013 one captivating performance at a time.

The Darcy Rice Center for the Arts is continuously buzzing with campus activity throughout the school year. Within the Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s, there are classes throughout the day in theater, choral, band, orchestra, dance and technical arts. After school brings rehearsals, the extended day dance conservatory, private practices, and performances and productions throughout the year including musicals, plays, concerts, film festivals and more. Even outside of the arts, the building is always in demand. Class meetings, convocation, special events, PTF gatherings and more keep the calendar full while requiring the facility be flexible for a wide range of uses. After 12 years as a campus centerpiece, the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts received its first major upgrade this summer. After the early June completion of Innovation Stage, a Summer at St. Margaret\u2019s program, the Center was closed for the next six weeks as a significant upgrade to the audio-visual system throughout the entire building was implemented ahead of the 2024-2025 school year. The project was led by the enterprise technology department, including Director of Enterprise Technology Nikki Imai and AV/Tech Support Specialist Eleury Sanchez, working in collaboration with the performing arts department led by Director of Performing Arts Dan Pacheco. \u201cThe Darcy Rice Center for the Arts is extraordinary, and more than a decade after its opening it remains a best-in-class facility for arts education and performing arts productions,\u201d Head of School Dr. Jeneen Graham said. \u201cThe building still feels new, yet we also recognize that technology has rapidly advanced and the needs of our school community have evolved as well. This investment in the Center\u2019s audio and visual capabilities will ensure that it remains second-to-none as a learning environment for our students well into the future. We could not be more excited.\u201d What most students and visitors will notice first is a major improvement in the building\u2019s sound quality. The facility was upgraded with a brand new high-quality Meyer Sound system powered by a Galaxy processor, allowing for a top-notch audio experience from anywhere in the facility with user-friendly controls. Both Hurlbut Theater and McGregor Family Theater were upgraded, as well as the Cloobeck Family Atrium and each of the classroom spaces dedicated to band, orchestra, choral and dance. In addition, the classrooms and all of the spaces in the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts had their high-definition television screens upgraded in quality and connectivity\u201430 screens in all. Teachers can seamlessly connect and control the screens via laptops or through touch-screen panels installed in each classroom. The building\u2019s video system was upgraded to a network-based matrix system by QSC. Now video can be broadcast to locations elsewhere within the Center in real time, such as a view from inside Hurlbut Theater to a dressing room--which will help performers off stage better follow the productions and their cues, for example. The project took nearly two years of planning, and an ambitious installation schedule ensured that the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts was open and ready for the first day of school in August. \u201cSo many people on campus put time and energy into this project,\u201d Ms. Imai said. \u201cThe IT department set aside hours and hours to make sure everything was compatible and worked well with existing systems. Our arts department dedicated time to make sure that we knew what they needed in the classroom and in the theaters. We also want to thank the rest of the community for adjusting to an entire summer of installation so that we could start the school year off right.\u201d The 45,000-square-foot facility includes Hurlbut Theater, McGregor Family Theater, the Cloobeck Family Atrium, three music teaching rooms, a dance studio, 11 private practice rooms and more. It opened in 2012 as the Performing Arts Center with significant input from the arts department in the building\u2019s design, acoustics, classroom specifications and more. The Nicholas family, who provided the foundational gift for project, named the building in honor of former Director of the Arts Darcy Rice after his retirement in 2022. With the upgraded audio and visual systems, the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts is poised to continue being a leading educational arts facility well into the future. \u201cWe are so excited for students and audiences to experience this upgrade,\u201d Mr. Pacheco said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hear it, and you\u2019re going to feel it.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

St. Margaret\u2019s Epsicopal School is pleased to announce that the Performing Arts Center has been named the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts, in honor of the school\u2019s longtime director of the arts who retired in June after a 22-year career at the helm. Naming the building after Mr. Rice had been in the works for a long time. The Nicholas family provided the foundational gift to St. Margaret\u2019s to build the state-of-the-art Performing Arts Center, which was completed in 2012. As part of that gift, the Nicholas family retained naming rights for the building. \u201cFrom the very beginning, our family believed that Darcy Rice was the only person worthy of having his name on the Performing Arts Center,\u201d said Stacey Nicholas, a St. Margaret\u2019s Trustee Emeritus and parent of three alumni who were all involved in the arts. \u201cWe thought that when he retired, it would be the perfect time to make that happen.\u201d Mr. Rice retired at the end of the 2021-2022 school year after 22 years leading St. Margaret\u2019s arts department. Among Mr. Rice\u2019s numerous contributions to the school, he oversaw, integrated and coordinated performing arts, visual arts and technical arts at the school, directed 53 performing-arts productions and taught theater classes for many years. He was also instrumental in the design of the Performing Arts Center which now bears his name, bringing his vision for an arts educational center to life, including specifying different acoustic designs, performance spaces, classroom studio features, a customizable main performance space, green room spaces for the multitude of annual live performances, a wardrobe studio and 11 private practice rooms available to students every day. The Nicholas family did not tell Mr. Rice of their plan to name the facility after him (\u201cwe had to keep the secret for a very long time,\u201d Ms. Nicholas said). Only after he retired did they reach out to the Rice family and St. Margaret\u2019s and share the news. \u201cWe are so overjoyed to be able to do this for him,\u201d Ms. Nicholas said. Signage with the new name was installed on the fa\u00e7ade of the building just prior to this week\u2019s production of the Upper School play The Importance of Being Earnest , which has brought Mr. Rice back to St. Margaret\u2019s to serve as guest director. \u201cWhen Darcy Rice joined St. Margaret\u2019s as a member of the professional community, he was a professional artist volunteering as a parent to direct a school production in quaint Sillers Hall. From there, he literally built the performing arts program,\u201d Head of School Will Moseley said. \u201cHe envisioned a world-class program, designed curriculum, hired the best artist-faculty and was instrumental in the design of the performing arts center as well. Mr. Rice put our arts program on the map and made it a destination for many Tartans who sought arts as an essential part of their academic pursuits. \u201cOn behalf of the entire St. Margaret\u2019s community, we congratulate Mr. Rice for this amazing honor and well-deserved acknowledgement of his vast contributions to St. Margaret\u2019s. We are also grateful to the Nicholas family for their continuing love, support and generosity toward St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School.\u201d The Darcy Rice Center for the Arts is a 45,000-square foot teaching and learning facility supporting instrumental music, choral music, dance and theater education and programs. The facility features two professional performance theaters--Hurlbut Theater and McGregor Family Theater\u2014in addition to music teaching rooms, a professional dance studio, a sound and video production studio and private practice rooms.

Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens through formal and informal opportunities that work to advance justice on behalf of all members of our community and the world. In all aspects of their school lives, St. Margaret's students are provided leadership opportunities and are able to initiate, explore, and practice leadership skills in a safe and encouraging environment. Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens and leaders through formal and informal opportunities. Leadership development in our students is actively promoted across all divisions at the classroom, division and school-wide levels through a cohesive program of leadership opportunities and development at the school. Students have the opportunity to demonstrate leadership on the athletic field, on stage, in service, or to better the culture and climate of the school community. Leadership, however, is not just traditional class positions that students can fill each year. Students feel empowered to identify their own leadership opportunities. Students discover that leadership is about finding their voice, mobilizing others, humility, and working hard, among other things, and that these are skills that will set them up for a life of positive impact. St. Margaret\u2019s students do not sit passively, but rather demonstrate their character and actively seek ways to better themselves, our school community and beyond. Leadership opportunities are abundant across all divisions and are developmentally paced for increasing responsibility, decision-making and voice. Students practice and demonstrate leadership in deliberate and meaningful ways as they move through the divisions from Preschool to Upper School. They learn citizenship in the Preschool and understand the importance of helping a friend and being fair, rise to the opportunity to be big buddy in Lower School, create a student club in the Middle School or offer a powerful address on an important topic in Upper School Convocation and organize support around it. St. Margaret\u2019s students respond to issues and needs, and they engage with one another with respect and admiration and distinguish themselves among their peers and beyond the St. Margaret\u2019s campus.

Our community believes that an essential outcome of St. Margaret\u2019s education is that students and graduates feel the compassion, responsibility and calling to serve others and be active and contributing citizens within their communities and the world. Our Episcopal identity guides our service learning program that aims to create understanding of community issues and challenges, engender empathy for others, nurture deeper connections and engagement, build cultural competency and life skills. Service learning and begins with developmentally-appropriate activities in the Early School and builds through the Upper School years. Service learning at St. Margaret's is experiential and requires students to understand the authentic needs of the community they are serving. Often service learning is tied to the content of our academic curriculum, making the service even more relevant and deepening the learning experience in a real setting. We emphasize and model the importance of service by purposefully taking time in the school day within all divisions and as an all-school community for service learning projects, rather than require students to count service hours accumulated after school or on weekends. St. Margaret\u2019s has formed long-term partnerships with local non-profit organizations and leverages these sustained relationships to further their missions within the communities they serve, and to provide powerful learning experiences for our students. Partner organizations include Family Assistance Ministries, The Ecology Center, Operation Help A Hero and the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, Padres Unidos, Second Harvest Food Bank, The Infant Pantry and Welcome INN. The lessons of these kinds of hands-on service experiences leave students with a new understanding of societal issues and inequities; underlining, systemic causes; and deep personal connections to the rewards of investing in and giving back to the community.

In further sharing the importance of service as part of St. Margaret\u2019s mission, Upper School junior Nick Fox shared his involvement in the Moseley Venture to Serve, as he helped organize a golf tournament which raised money for Special Camp. \u201cIf you blend the things you love with the things you care about, you can start leading a life of service,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have had the chance to lead this project, and I am proud of St. Margaret\u2019s for being a place that teaches us the importance of leading lives of service.\u201d The All-School Spring Service also included beautiful music\u2014performances of \u201cStand By Me\u201d by St. Margaret\u2019s choral and orchestra students, and the hymn \u201cI Sing a Song of the Saints of God\u201d which was also played when St. Margaret\u2019s first opened in 1979. As the All-School Spring Service coincided with the first day of spring and Nowruz, two Upper School students spoke of the Persian New Year and wished students a Happy Nowruz and happy first day of spring, inviting students to visit haftseen tables set up in each of the divisions. The ceremony concluded with a prayer for the Class of 2025 by Head of School Dr. Jeneen Graham, as the senior class prepares for the final months of their time at St. Margaret\u2019s. \u201cMay they shine as models of hope, carrying the essence of St. Margaret\u2019s spirit in all their actions and interactions, illuminating paths not just for themselves, but for the world,\u201d Dr. Graham said. \u201cAmen.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

St. Margaret's kicked off its All-School Service Learning Project last month during the St. Margaret\u2019s Day celebration. This year\u2019s partnership is with Special Camp, an organization hosted by St. Margaret\u2019s which brings youth with disabilities together with counselors for week-long day camps in the summer and activities throughout the school year. The All-School Service Learning Project will continue into the spring, with a service element involving the entire school community as well activities planned across all four divisions with the goal of deepening the commitment to inclusion, leadership, and community engagement. These activities started last week, as Special Camp campers, counselors and Upper School student volunteers visited the Lower School to engage in activities and education centered around the disabled community. A particularly memorable part of each session was Musical Cones, an adaptive version of the classic game of musical chairs. By swapping out chairs for cones and making other slight adjustments, Special Camp's team demonstrated how small changes to traditional games can make them accessible to everyone regardless of ability. \u201cThese activities fostered empathy and understanding while promoting the value of inclusive play,\u201d Special Camp Director Lindsay Eres said. Throughout the sessions, Special Camp campers offered valuable perspectives. A special moment highlighted one of the campers teaching the Lower School students how to say Merry Christmas in American Sign Language (ASL). In addition, Upper School students served an essential role supporting Special Camp Staff modeling leadership and inclusion. The Lower School students also had the chance to share some of their favorite games: tag, Sorry!, and hide-and-seek. Mrs. Eres and Associate Director Katie Schwartz led the Lower School students in brainstorming ideas to adapt these games to demonstrate how to make playtime more accessible. In addition to the educational touchpoints, the All-School Service Learning Project is also an opportunity to partner with and support the local community.

Lower School students in grade 3 led a Tartan delegation of students, professional community members and parents last weekend at the Family Assistance Ministries\u2019 37th Annual Hunger Walk in San Clemente. The grade 3 involvement is tied to the grade-level focus on Global Goal No. 2, zero hunger. In addition to spreading the word about the event and raising funds to support FAM, the grade 3 students also invited their kindergarten buddies to take part in the walk. Grade 3 students gained valuable insights into food scarcity in South Orange County, helping them understand the important work that FAM does for the community. St. Margaret\u2019s school and church was also a combined team and was honored at the walk for the long standing partnership between the organization, students, infant pantry and church. In total, more than 80 members of the St. Margaret\u2019s school and church community took part in the two mile walk, and more than $5,000 was raised in support of FAM, which works to assist people in need in Orange County.

St. Margaret\u2019s Fountain Courtyard turned into a shopping extravaganza with books, toys, clothes, pajamas and holiday cheer, the culmination of a service-learning project benefiting Orange County families. Santa\u2019s Scottie Village is an annual community outreach in its ninth year led by St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School with collaboration from St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church and Padres Unidos. The project supports local families who participate in a weekly preschool and parent education program at the Church through Padres Unidos, a non-profit group of community workers who serve families in Orange Country through a variety of child, youth and family services. \u201cIn Santa\u2019s Scottie Village students are participating in every step of the service. After learning about Padres Unidos, sharing the goal, helping to request donations, working together to collect, sort and even display items, they are so excited to see the gifts find a home with families from Padres Unidos,\u201d said Tupper Spring, Lower School director of community life. The Lower School community, guided by the leadership of grade 4 students, united to support the project through a donation drive. The initiative collected a variety of gifts, including pajamas, dolls, books, toys, and clothing. The event was made even more festive with beautifully decorated shopping bags, a wrapping station, and personalized Christmas cards, adding a special touch to the joyful season. \u201cI love getting to see our students feel empowered and such joy in an act of service,\u201d said Ms. Spring. The project aligns with grade 4\u2019s global goal of sustainable cities and communities, as students learned the importance of supporting families in the building of a strong community.

For most of the month of March, St. Margaret\u2019s students were engaged in the All-School Service Learning Project\u2014an annual springtime activity that brings the school community together around a shared purpose in service to the local community. This year, the school partnered with Orange County Head Start, an organization that serves more than 2,300 children ages zero to five to provide \u201ca comprehensive child development program designed to meet the educational emotional, social, health and nutritional needs of children and families.\u201d Before the start of the All-School Service Learning Project in February, school leaders met with OC Head Start to assess the authentic needs of organization\u2019s two San Juan Capistrano centers. \u201cAfter meeting with the Head Start leaders, we learned that having a garden at each site would be a new, impactful and hands-on way to teach their students about the earth, life cycles and healthy eating,\u201d Upper School junior Emma Kim said at last week\u2019s All-School Spring Service. With the goal to build a garden at each Head Start location and provide supplies and learning resources to go along with it, St. Margaret\u2019s students went to work. Early School and Middle School students came together in early March to read a book about gardening and plant seedlings that would be given to each Head Start student. Later in the month, Lower School and Upper School students joined to learn more about OC Head Start and plant seedlings of different fruits and vegetables that would be put in the new gardens. There were also several direct connections with OC Head Start. Leaders from the organization visited St. Margaret\u2019s to learn more about the school\u2019s garden and the learning opportunities, as well as work out details on the garden builds. In addition, two Upper School advisories visited each Head Start location multiple times to serve the organization and assess the future garden sites. St. Margaret\u2019s also had Upper School advisories create bilingual plant identifiers and build the garden wagons. Another component of the project was a donation drive, with the Lower School and Middle School leading the efforts. By the end of the project, families donated more than 180 items to help with Head Start\u2019s garden curriculum\u2014essential supplies such as kid-sized shovels, gloves, watering cans, seed packets, wagons, garden-related books for young children and more. The project concluded last week at the All-School Spring Service, when the details and results from the project were shared by Vivi B. in grade 5, Tayler Sant and grade 8 and Emma in grade 11. \u201cAs we have embarked on this journey, we have learned so much about communities,\u201d Emma said. \u201cWe have learned the importance of early-childhood education and the impact it can have on a child for the rest of their life. We have also learned about Mother Earth, the gifts provided by the land, and how it is our responsibility to care for the only planet we will ever have.\u201d The new gardens will be built in the near future. As part of their service-learning block, multiple Upper School advisories will continue to visit the OC Head Start centers in San Juan Capistrano to help with the upkeep of the new gardens once they are built. The All-School Service Learning Project was overseen by St. Margaret\u2019s service-learning team, including Director of Equity and Inclusion Victor Cota, Directors of Community Life Lora Allison (Upper School), Kylie Middlebrook (Middle School) and Tupper Spring (Lower School), Early School Pedagogista Sonia Yoshizawa and administrative assistant Nina Miranda. The All-School Service Learning Project is an opportunity to embrace St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal identity and live out the school\u2019s mission to educate the hearts and minds of young people for lives of learning, leadership and service. Past partners in the All-School Service Learning project include the Boys & Girls Clubs of Capistrano Valley, St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church\u2019s Infant Pantry, Family Assistance Ministries and The Ecology Center.

Episcopal schools are not solely communities for Christians, rather as ecumenical and diverse ministries of educational and human formation for people of all faiths and backgrounds. Episcopal schools also integrate religious and spiritual formation into the curriculum and life of the school community. Episcopal schools exist not merely to educate, but to demonstrate and proclaim the unique worth and beauty of all human beings. Chapel at St. Margaret's Led by St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School chaplains, Chapel is an integral part of the student experience for every student, nurturing character, grace, community fellowship and spiritual wellness. Every student participates in Chapel services weekly as a dedicated time in the school schedule for proclamation, celebration, solace and reflection of God\u2019s goodness and unconditional love. Chapel services and the Church campus, including the Fountain Courtyard, meditation labyrinth and garden, are sacred and safe spaces always open to students and members of the St. Margaret\u2019s community. Chapel also reinforces the sacred in ourselves and everything around us, and encourages taking time to pause, reflect and appreciate personal truth and life\u2019s authentic joys. It develops mindfulness and a deeper connection with individual spirituality and respect and care for others. The student body and professional community of each division gather as a community for Chapel as a part of the weekly schedule\u2014Early Childhood School gathers weekly, Lower School begins Monday through Thursday with Chapel, Middle School gathers twice a week and Upper School once a week. Readings, prayers and homilies are thoughtfully selected and developed by the chaplains to reflect life and the multiple faiths within the school community. Students have leadership opportunities to serve as acolytes or readers, and offer a homily that reflects upon the reading, and musical or dance performances. Through the tradition of Chapel, students also learn and practice the proper respect and decorum of a sacred space and learn to appreciate its place and value in their lives.

Each student is assigned an advisor, with Middle School students getting a new advisor each school year, while Upper School students keep the same advisor for four years beginning in grade 9. Students view their advisor as a mentor, a personal cheerleader, or someone who could guide them if a challenge arises. The school views the advisor as the person on campus who knows and best cares for each student and will be a trusted counselor and supporter. Advisory groups meet weekly to discuss current adolescent topics and social issues, reflect on guest speakers and school topics, perform service-learning projects, guide academic progress, and to simply connect with one another. The advisory groups become a constant, tight-knit, school family for each student. The advisory structure also provides a framework for students to be involved in Chapel, school-wide events, and retreats both on and off campus. Advisors seek to know the students beyond the classroom, and serve as a liaison for their parents, teachers, coaches and administrators to work together for the benefit of the student.

Our early childhood program is designed to engage the youngest learners to develop socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively through developmentally appropriate practices rich in social connections, language, literacy, math and other disciplinary skills and content. More than 100 years of research has shown us the importance of children\u2019s learning through play and exploration. Current research only solidifies the understanding that children learn best when they are actively and mentally engaged in their own learning. St. Margaret\u2019s knowledgeable and experienced educators facilitate and guide students with well thought strategies and environments that motivate and encourage preschool-age learners to investigate, question, problem solve and discover. In the classroom, children learn to navigate friendships by sharing materials, taking turns and taking perspective of others\u2019 ideas. Cognitive skills are further developed through investigation and exploration. Teachers provide materials and activities that develop literacy, numeracy and scientific thinking. Children are encouraged to question, create, problem-solve and explore. The learning does not end in the classroom. The nationally recognized Outdoor Classroom is purposefully designed for children to discover the natural world by spending time observing and feeding chickens, building with blocks, planting in the garden, catching rollie pollies, and watching caterpillars change over time. The Outdoor Classroom also helps children strengthen their physical abilities through riding bikes, climbing, lifting and dancing. The Early School is a wonderful place for preschool-age learners to develop a foundation for a love of learning through a socially and academically vigorous learning environment. Dr. Cris Lozon, Director, Early School St. Margaret\u2019s Early Childhood School is committed to providing quality care based on our knowledge of current research and best practices. For more than 40 years we have provided quality daily experiences and positive outcomes for preschool children at St. Margaret\u2019s.

A beloved corner of St. Margaret\u2019s campus is experiencing new life this spring. The Early School Garden, nestled beside the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts parking lot, has undergone a thoughtful redesign\u2014one that brings both innovation and inspiration to the school\u2019s youngest learners. The transformation reflects the Early School\u2019s commitment to hands-on, nature-based education, rooted in the Reggio Emilia philosophy and a constructivist approach to learning. The refreshed space includes a newly installed iron trellis that marks the entrance to the school's garden, also featuring a newly constructed \u201cchicken condo,\u201d a large, carefully designed coop where Early School students may observe and care for live chickens. Alongside it, a new water feature, improved accessible pathways, and raised flower beds create an engaging environment for Early School students to explore. A new greenhouse was built in the Garden last school year as part of a PTF grant. Early School students are provided an opportunity to engage in a range of activities in the Garden: measuring soil, tracking the growth of seedlings, designing signage, and studying insect habitats. These immersive experiences are integrated into the broader curriculum, reinforcing skills across disciplines. From identifying patterns in seeds to observing how plants respond to watering, St. Margaret\u2019s youngest Tartans are developing foundational scientific thinking in the Garden. The Early School educators emphasize that time spent learning and playing outdoors supports holistic child development\u2014cognitive, social-emotional, and physical. In this setting, the Early School garden serves as a dynamic co-teacher, fostering curiosity, persistence and critical thinking. \u201cThe collaborative nature of gardening builds a culture of care and belonging, as children take turns watering, harvesting, and feeding the hens,\u201d said Erika Garcia, Early School outdoor and motor development teacher. \u201cThese shared responsibilities foster a sense of interdependence and strengthen classroom relationships.\u201d In addition, the harvests from the garden often end up in the Early School\u2019s demonstration lab, where children prepare recipes using their own produce. \u201cPlanting with purpose allows children to witness the full life cycle of plants from tiny seeds to thriving plants, and with that comes powerful lessons,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cWhen children carefully place seeds in the soil, tend to them each day, and observe them grow, they are learning about responsibility, patience, and care. And when it comes time to harvest, we often hear proud declarations like, \u2018I grew this!\u2019\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

St. Margaret\u2019s PreK-12 campus continues to provide unique opportunities for students to connect through cross-divisional opportunities, enriching their educational experience with moments of joyful learning and interaction. This week, the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts became the setting for a special event that brought together Upper and Middle School students with Early School students at the annual \"Musical Petting Zoo.\" Upper and Middle School orchestra students hosted the event, which gave Early School students the chance to explore a variety of musical instruments in an interactive and engaging setting. The older students led demonstrations of instruments such as the cello, double bass, flute, and violin. Early School children were invited to try out percussion instruments, including tambourines, maracas, and finger cymbals, offering them a hands-on introduction to instruments and music. The \"Musical Petting Zoo\" has become a beloved activity at St. Margaret\u2019s. For many of the younger students, the experience marked a memorable moment of connection with their older peers and a glimpse into the world of music and performance. Orchestra Director Linling Hsu expressed her enthusiasm for the event saying, \"The Musical Petting Zoo is one of my favorite events of the school year. It warms my heart to see our Middle and Upper School students perform for and interact with our youngest Tartans. It\u2019s such a meaningful way to introduce children to the magic of music and the idea of an orchestra as one big musical family. Letting them see, hear, and even touch the instruments plants seeds of curiosity and inspiration.\" The morning concluded with a live performance of Red Rhythmico , showcasing the talent of the older students and leaving the Early School students with curiosity and inspiration. This event serves as a perfect example of St. Margaret\u2019s commitment to fostering connection, creativity, and a love of learning across all grade levels.

The Early School was transformed into a marvelous showcase of student learning on Thursday, as the 7th annual WOW Night brought families to St. Margaret\u2019s for a celebration of the meaningful play-based learning that took place throughout the school year. Families are invited to WOW, or Works of Wonder, an annual event in the Early School for an opportunity to see student work and student-led projects. Families visited classrooms, the atelier (art studio), the Demonstration Lab and the Outdoor Classroom. \u201cChildren\u2019s learning unfolds through inquiry, play, and collaboration and WOW Night serves as a powerful tool to make children\u2019s learning visible, showcasing how they synthesize their knowledge and ideas,\u201d said Early School Director Dr. Cris Lozon. This child-centered approach lies at the core of educational philosophy, evident in the documentation showcased in each classroom and Outdoor Classroom. The documentation not only makes the children\u2019s learning visible to others but also empowers the children to take ownership of their learning journey. Dr. Lozon emphasized the valuable influence Early School students had preparing for WOW night, \u201cThe WOW exhibit was not just a display of learning but a creation shaped by the children\u2019s ideas. Through their voices and contributions, they built, curated, and defined the landscape, making their perspective an essential part of the experience.\u201d The Early School students also practiced their docent skills with their peers. Then, later in the morning they practiced again with the professional community. By the evening they were well prepared for their families. The displays in each classroom differ and represent various academic disciplines, encompassing math, literacy, as well as engineering and scientific thinking. Students moved excitedly between classrooms with their families, eager to show off the wondrous learning that took place during the year. With community and fellowship, attendees enjoyed food and refreshments, reconnecting with families and interacting with the Early School\u2019s expert faculty. St. Margaret\u2019s Early School is a play- and researched-based academic program with roots in constructivist teaching and the renowned Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. Reggio Emilia schools have a design of openness to community and a willingness to share ideas, which inspired the first WOW Night in 2019.

In The Upper School the professional community participated in sharing stories during their division meeting about culture, Chinese zodiac signs, as well as the significance of red envelopes which traditionally symbolize prosperity, good wishes and luck for the new year ahead. There were delicious dumplings also available to sample. The Upper School quad was decorated in red provided by the generosity of St. Margaret\u2019s parents, but also supported by student groups including the AAPI Affinity Group and the Chinese Culture Club. Later in the week Upper School students led a Chapel homily, followed by a captivating performance of the lion dance. Upper School student Charlotte Jiang, a member of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) student affinity group, shared her perspective about Lunar New Year as a more meaningful opportunity to reconnect with family and community. She said, \u201cTo me, Lunar New Year is about generations of Asian American immigrants and culture; it represents the immeasurable love parents have for kids and the beauty of connecting people who have never experienced the holiday in their mother country with people whose first time celebrating outside of Asia.\u201d In the Middle School, grade 6 student Amy Weng spoke during Chapel about how the cherished occasion is a time to honor deep-rooted traditions, strengthen bonds with family, and embrace opportunities. A few parents also set up a photo booth for Middle School students in the courtyard to foster community and celebrate during lunch. In both the Early and Lower School divisions, parents visited a number of classrooms to share about Lunar New Year and their own cultural traditions. Students created traditional crafts, such as red lanterns and dragon masks. The festivities also included a lion dance performance that took place on the Lower School playground, as both Early School and Lower School students joyfully watched the performance. The Lunar New Year is celebrated around the world, and is also referred to as the Spring Festival in many cultures. The holiday lasts 15 days until the first full moon of the Lunar Calendar, and its start date ranges from January 29 to February 12.

The All-School Service Learning Project is an annual tradition at St. Margaret\u2019s, a chance for all divisions to unite and meet the authentic needs of a partner organization, provide a cross-divisional opportunity for student learning, and rally the school community around a common purpose. The project launched at the St. Margaret\u2019s Day All-School service in November, and will conclude at the All-School Spring Service in March. Special Camp has been hosted at St. Margaret's since 1992. Special Camp brings youth with disabilities and peer counselors together for week-long summer day camps and activities throughout the year. Special Camp provides a safe space for having fun and building genuine, life-long friendships. Counselors are given the chance to work in a positive, nurturing environment that fosters an educational atmosphere of opportunities to explore the intricacies and the needs of this community with a focus on learning abilities, communication skills, emotional well-being, and social development. The organization supports more than 150 campers and 150 counselors annually. As part of the learning, St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School students were paired with Upper School students this week, dividing into small groups and rotating through the five Special Camp activity centers. Students had the opportunity to see and participate in the centers, similar to Special Camp students\u2019 experience during the summer program. These activity centers include arts and crafts, entertainment, games and reading, sensory integration and sports. In addition, Middle School students and Early School students have connected several times, reading children\u2019s books about inclusivity with a focus on the disabled community. Looking ahead, they will have the opportunity to experience the activity centers first-hand on Friday, January 24. The goal of the activity center visits is for students to spend time together, learn more about the Special Camp program, and support the donation drive to supply the Special Camp activity centers. The activity centers are utilized during Special Camp programming to provide spaces for campers to have fun, hang out, and decompress, while meeting their range of needs. St. Margaret\u2019s All-School Service Learning Project is funded by the William N. Moseley Venture to Serve, an endowment fund created in 2023 by the Board of Trustees to fund the All-School Service Learning Project as well as grants for students, alumni and professional community members interested in serving the community.

Director of Equity and Inclusion Victor Cota and Upper School student Avery Lind also shared more about the service-learning program at St. Margaret\u2019s, including the Moseley Venture to Serve initiative and the All-School Service Learning Project. \u201cFor all of us here at St. Margaret\u2019s, service is less about something you do and more about something you are ,\u201d Mr. Cota said. \u201cTo commit to a life of service means to understand that the world is bigger than any one person or any one community. It means understanding that each of us has a profound opportunity to be change-makers. Students at St. Margaret\u2019s begin to learn as young as Early School that they have the power to affect change in the world, and we cultivate this mindset and skillset all the way through high school graduation.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

In addition, Mr. Westhead announced the creation of the William N. Moseley Venture to Serve Endowment. \u201cThe income generated by the Moseley Endowment will provide ongoing financial support for future All-School Service Learning Projects,\u201d Mr. Westhead said. \u201cIn addition, the new endowment will also provide funding for service venture grants for those students, alumni and members of our professional community who are looking to create new and innovative ways to serve our community.\u201d The first recipient of a Moseley Venture to Serve grant was announced at the All-School Spring Service this week. Upper School junior Dania Arteaga and her brother recently started the Bridges Clinic, a pop-up clinic which provides healthcare services for underserved, uninsured residents of South Orange County. At their first clinic, they served 54 patients--many of which had not been to a doctor in years. \u201cDania was happy with these results. She knew she had made a difference. But she wanted to do more,\u201d said Victor Cota, St. Margaret\u2019s Director of Equity and Inclusion and service-learning team leader. \u201cAt one point, I remember Dania reaching out to me personally to see if I knew any way to keep the momentum going. I didn\u2019t. \u201cBut now, with funds from the Moseley Venture to Serve, we can revive Bridges Clinic. It is our distinct honor to award Dania Arteaga $6,000 to continue this powerful work. With these funds, Dania will have the opportunity to continue this important work and meet a critical need in our local community.\u201d More details about the Moseley Venture to Serve will be shared in the coming weeks, including information on how students, alumni and the professional community can apply for a grant.

In the Early School program, physical activity plays a vital role in fostering both core strength and confidence in young learners. Stepping into the Outdoor Classroom motor area, students are seen climbing ropes, supporting one another, and tackling physical challenges that build strength and resilience. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasizes the connection between physical health and academic performance, making it clear that activities like climbing, swinging, and jumping do more than just promote fitness\u2014they enhance a student\u2019s ability to engage in the classroom. The importance of these activities extends beyond exercise. As students pull wagons, jump on trampolines, or climb, they develop essential physical skills that directly support their academic success. In St. Margaret\u2019s Early School, the curriculum incorporates movement because of its role in helping students establish a strong foundation for learning. Early School Director Dr. Cris Lozon remarks, \"When children build core strength through physical activities, it helps them focus better during circle time, sit attentively, and engage more fully in classroom tasks. These physical skills are the foundation for their academic growth and overall success.\" By promoting physical fitness alongside cognitive development, St. Margaret\u2019s Early School program empowers students to build confidence, improve focus, and lay the groundwork for future success in both academic and leadership roles. Through this approach, young learners are not only ready for the classroom, but also for a lifetime of growth, learning, and service.

St. Margaret\u2019s Early School prepares students to read and write through its play-based curriculum. At the Early School, the science of early literacy development is recognizing that play is not just a form of recreation, but a crucial component of learning. Students begin the literacy journey through playful interactions with each other and at independent play. Early reading skills include engaging with books, labeling pictures, commenting on stories, in addition to scribbling and making intentional marks which foster writing abilities. The Early School learning environment is supported with resources designed to guide students through developmental milestones. The curriculum encourages students to explore letters, shapes and symbols. Students learn to differentiate what these are, therefore transforming their understanding through hands-on experiences. In the classroom, children may choose books to read with friends, or play alphabet puzzles. Moreover, the Early School Outdoor Classroom provides an environment for students to engage in play-based learning by using chalk to draw arrows or write \"go\" and \"stop\" on the concrete, or creating traffic patterns for tricycles. Then, there are other opportunities to scribble menu items on clipboards or make birthday cards for friends through drawings and letters. Early School educators place an emphasis on the physical environment when creating opportunities for students to freely choose to read and write. For instance, food menus, envelopes, and paper are placed in the dramatic play area, while cardboard signs in the block area are intentionally set up to encourage students to engage with reading and writing. Furthermore, teachers model reading and writing every day at circle time or encourage curious minds as students ask how to spell a word. \u201cOur learning environment provides rich resources to engage with to support early reading and writing,\u201d said Early School Director Dr. Cris Lozon. Embedding literacy skills in play and providing these rich resources allows St. Margaret\u2019s Early School educators to guide developmental readiness, as students learn about letters, shapes and colors through play. Ultimately, by weaving play into the fabric at St. Margaret's Early School, students are equipped to develop cognitively through developmentally appropriate practices rich in social connections, language, and learning.

St. Margaret's played host to early childhood educators, administrators and policy makers last week at the inaugural 2024 Summer Institute. Over two full days of enlightening and research-based professional development, the program explored the essential role of play in early childhood education. Over 50 attendees from around the nation including local Orange County and Los Angeles County educators as well as attendees from Washington D.C., Texas, Northern California, Tennessee and Maryland. The program included presentations from keynote speakers, classroom observations at St. Margaret's renowned Early School, workshops, panel discussions and more. Dr. Cris Lozon, St. Margaret's Early School director, expressed the transformative impact of the Summer Institute on the professional development of educators and policymakers, \"The institute provided a unique platform for our teachers and guest speakers to share their expertise and for the attendees to witness theory in practice, fostering a sense of growth and progress in our collective understanding of early childhood education.\" The Summer Institute included a look into the latest findings from neuroscience to understand how play actively engages and motivates children, fostering their physical, cognitive, and social development. These findings have practical implications for early childhood educators, as they can use them to design play-based activities that promote specific aspects of children's development. In addition, a closer exploration of methodologies for tracking children's growth over time using developmental continuums and observational techniques was part of gaining insights into play-based projects initiated by children. A particular focus on discovering projects aligned with cross-cutting concepts and interdisciplinary studies provided a balanced educational foundation. Dr. Sandra Stone, Professor Emerita of Northern Arizona University and author, delivered the keynote address at the inaugural event. Her presentation, \u201cWhat is Play: A Closer Look at Research,\u201d set the tone for subsequent sessions. Early School professional community members Dr. Jennifer Hardison, Early School Outdoor Classroom teacher, and Tammy Pipitone, Early School teacher, shared their insights on art and play in the studio setting. Erika Garcia, Early School Outdoor Classroom teacher, and Hope Petrozzi, Early School teacher, discussed the role of play in the study of life science in the Outdoor Community Garden.

St. Margaret\u2019s Early School teachers Hope Petrozzi, Jennifer Hardison, Erika Garcia and Sonia Yoshizawa and Director of Educational Technology, Angela Mackenzie, recently attended the Reggio Emilia Study Group in Reggio Emilia, Italy, immersing in the renowned Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. The study group provided a deep dive into the principles and practices that define Reggio Emilia, emphasizing the importance of child-led learning and daily family involvement. Reggio Emilia Centers value each child's unique capabilities and interests while promoting inquiry-based learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving. exploration, and a more personalized learning experience. The study group highlighted the importance of child-led learning and daily family involvement, emphasizing the child's perspective, creativity, and exploration in learning. There is a unique educational partnership highlighted by the study. \u201cOne valuable aspect I found was the shift in the role of the teacher to that of a facilitator and co-learner, promoting a collaborative educational process,\u201d Mrs. Petrozzi said. The study emphasizes the value of implementing elements of the Reggio Emilia approach at St. Margaret\u2019s, promoting critical thinking, creativity, and a deep sense of engagement in the learning journey. \u201cThe work done in Reggio Emilia schools is truly inspirational and in a sense their philosophy and teaching approach is a way of living within the community,\u201d added Ms. Garcia, Early School Outdoor Classroom. \u201cThrough their documentation I can see that the children are seen, valued and have a voice in their learning journey.\u201d The Early School teachers experienced the invaluable perspectives and innovative strategies learned from the Reggio Emilia Study Group. Ms. Garcia expressed her eagerness to implement lessons into the classroom, \u201cThe study has confirmed our commitment to working with recycled materials with children, similar to Reggio\u2019s Remida Lab.\u201d This will not only promote sustainability but also encourages creativity and hands-on exploration through tinkering. By incorporating recycled materials, we can instill a sense of environmental consciousness and foster innovative thinking among our students.\u201d It is evident that St. Margaret\u2019s curriculum is providing the benefits of this learning to Early School students. Mrs. Petrozzi remarks, \u201cReflecting on our Early School program, I have come to appreciate the depth of knowledge that our educators possess and their continuous commitment to learning, which ultimately benefits not only the teaching staff but also every student in our care.\u201d An additional value involves how students and teachers embark on unit lessons and experiment with a variety of creative mediums. Dr. Hardison, art studio teacher shared, \u201cAs atelierista for the Early School, the ability to speak with an atelierista from Reggio Emilia helped me to see how we can better organize how the Early School students can engage with the art studio and myself more intentionally to become better aligned with St. Margaret\u2019s constructivist approach to young children\u2019s thinking.\u201d The Early School environment is a treasure trove of rich materials providing children with endless opportunities to engage, explore, and discover. The excitement resides in the prospect of sharing and implementing newfound insights to cultivate a more immersive and rewarding learning environment for St. Margaret\u2019s students. St. Margaret\u2019s Early School teachers who attended the study all agree that the experience continues to enhance how they work with each other as colleagues, and also how they work with Early School students to build the foundation for their future academic learning.

The Space Exploration Exhibit is a cross-divisional collaborative project between St. Margaret\u2019s Upper School astronomy students, Middle School astronomy club students, and grade 3 science students. The Space Exploration Exhibit displays hand-built physical models of past, present, and future space missions, and is specifically designed for Early and Lower School students to spark curiosity about the vast universe, invoke a sense of wonder about the unknown, and highlight the process of scientific discovery. The project was developed through an Innovation Summer Grant where teachers are provided an opportunity to spend time over the summer to work on innovative projects designed to enrich and elevate the student learning experience through experiential and interdisciplinary learning, the integration of emerging technologies into the curriculum, or creating opportunities for cross-divisional collaboration. The learning experience provides students a platform to prepare their imaginations for the future as Stephanie Capen, director of institutional research, remarks: \"What's especially exciting about this project is that several of the space missions in the exhibit are set to happen in the next 10 to 30 years. These missions, that they first learn about now, will continue to unfold and new discoveries will be made throughout their lifetime.\u201d The exhibit featured models of various targets in the Solar System which humans have explored or will explore with scientific instrumentation on spacecrafts. The astronomy students created models of the mission targets like planets, asteroids or moons, inspired by Middle School astronomy club designs, that illustrate the key scientific questions or discoveries of their selected space mission. The grade 3 students engineered small replicas of the mission-specific spacecraft. The exhibit dives into scientific questions and promotes discoveries and new learnings as Dr. Capen describes, \u201cThere is so much we still don't know about the universe; so much to wonder, and much yet to learn and discover. It reminds us that learning doesn't stop, and it's important that we continue to wonder, imagine, and live out lives of learning well beyond our years in school.\" Leading up to the exhibit, both Upper School astronomy students and grade 3 science students read books about the planets, creating and playing with spinning planet tops to illustrate planet rotation, and launching rockets to illustrate the concept of force and how we get spacecrafts to these far out worlds. The cross-divisional collaboration sparks more than just curiosity; it also ignites an opportunity to engage with each other as Mr. Beshk explains, \u201cMy Grade 3 students love the cross-divisional projects. Providing them with the opportunity to engage with and learn from the Upper School students is what makes St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School incredibly special.\u201d The project began several weeks ago, as Dr. Capen's Upper School astronomy students conducted research on past, present, or future space missions such as Europa Clipper, Artemis, Cassini and New Horizons to name a few. The Upper School astronomy students put together mission research briefs highlighting the type of mission, key facts about the mission target, and what students discovered or hoped to discover as a result of the space mission. The mission research briefs were delivered to Lower School science teacher Mr. Beshk's classroom, as part of the next phase. Grade 3 students were the engineers who designed a small replica of the spacecraft. The Middle School astronomy club, advised by Middle School science teacher Ashley Baffa, began researching the targets of each mission like Jupiter, Pluto, Titan, Saturn or the Moon, and designed a blueprint for a physical model of each target. The Upper School students worked on building the physical models of each mission target inspired by the Middle School astronomy club designs. As the Space Exploration Exhibit is intended for Early School-aged students, the Upper School astronomy students and Grade 3 science students conducted activities with the Early School students leading up to the exhibit day. This was a great opportunity for the Upper School students to build relationships with Early School students, and acquire a thorough perspective on how Early School students would experience the exhibit. The Upper School astronomy students read a book called \u201c8 Little Planets,\u201d to Early School students, followed by an activity including coloring and playing with spinning planet tops designed by the Upper School students to illustrate the concept of rotation and how it related to the solar system. The following week, Mr. Beshk's grade 3 science students conducted a stomp rocket activity for Early School students, illustrating the concept of force and how we are able to send spacecraft into space. The culmination of all the research, designing, building, and playing, is what makes the Space Exploration Exhibit a valuable experience. Last week, each Early School class and several Lower School classes walked through the exhibit with the opportunity to see and touch the models, while discovering and stimulating more interest about astronomy and the Solar System. Mr. Beshk expresses the lasting life lessons students will take with them beyond St. Margaret\u2019s classrooms. \u201cThe relationships between the Lower and Upper School students will carry on throughout this year and more years to come. While walking to a special subject class or joining an all school ceremony, these Tartans will smile and say hi to each other, creating a deeper sense of community and empathy, priceless educational and life lessons.\u201d The Space Exploration Exhibit will be on display in Mr. Beshk's classroom at the upcoming STEAM Expo on Saturday, April 20.

St. Margaret\u2019s 2024 All-School Service Learning Project is underway, with students from every division participating in activities and education as part of a partnership with Orange County Head Start. The All-School Service Learning Project is a springtime tradition at St. Margaret\u2019s, a chance for all divisions to unite and meet the authentic needs of a partner organization, provide a cross-divisional opportunity for student learning, and rally the school community around a common purpose. Orange County Head Start\u2019s mission is to provide children and their families with quality childhood development programs and integrated support services. Orange County Head Start has been a community partner with St. Margaret\u2019s for many years. This week, St. Margaret\u2019s students made progress on the project\u2019s goal to build two gardens for the two Orange County Head Start locations in San Juan Capistrano. On Wednesday, students in the Middle School and Early School came together for an important and joyful touchpoint around the project. Middle School students read the book Lola Plants a Garden to the Early School students, before the older and younger Tartans together took part in an activity taking small pots decorated by Early School students and planting strawberries in them, which will be given to Orange County Head Start students. Also this week, two Upper School advisories visited the San Juan Capistrano Head Start locations to assess the garden spaces and interact with Head Start students and faculty. Upper School students will work to design and build the garden structures this spring. As part of the project, Tartan students will learn about Orange County Head Start, the needs of the greater community and the impact the addition of gardens will have at Orange County Head Start locations. Multiple cross-divisional activities are planned, culminating with the conclusion of the project at the All-School Spring Service on March 21. There are multiple ways for St. Margaret\u2019s families to support the school\u2019s All-School Service Learning Project. Donation drives have been set up in each division to supply Head Start\u2019s gardens and classrooms with tools, garden supplies and books. You can view the Amazon Wishlist at this link and the Lower School\u2019s Sign-Up Genius at this link . Those interested in making a monetary donation can do so at this link . St. Margaret\u2019s All-School Service Learning Project is funded by the William N.

Our Lower School program is designed to prepare your child for a life of learning, leadership and service. In keeping with our mission and guiding force, we focus our program on learning through commitment, leadership through character development, and service through community. Learning Through Commitment St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School is committed to upholding high academic expectations. Our best asset, aside from our students, is our highly educated, caring and professional team of educators. Whether it be our commitment to small class sizes with classroom and special subject teachers engaged in the learning of each child, robust science, technology, engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) programs, our excellence in teaching language arts and the humanities, a vibrant visual arts and music program, or our support in developing the whole child through our training in positive behavior support systems and character education, we continue to grow professionally and adapt our program in order to meet the needs of each and every student at St. Margaret\u2019s. Leadership Through Character Development Our faculty and students are proud to live by the six pillars of the Character Counts program: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship. Our Lower School Student Leadership, faculty and parents work hard to continue to model and teach each of these character traits. Our first weeks of school focus on behavioral expectations for life at St. Margaret\u2019s. Homeroom and Specialist teachers, Co-Teachers, and administrators model and teach these traits and guide students in making good decisions in their social, emotional and academic lives. St. Margaret\u2019s Tartans are taught pro-social behavior as they learn to navigate their ever-changing minds and bodies. We reward this PAWsitive behavior with Class Dojo points, incentives, special privileges and much more. Our professional community instills morals and values in fun and engaging ways. There are spirit days and reward days where the excitement is almost palpable and all the while the children are reminded that PAWsitive character is what great leaders are made of. Service Through Community Our community consists of our students, professional community, and families. We foster an atmosphere in which all feel they have a voice and an integral part in the St. Margaret\u2019s family. We work hard to enhance communication with parents and students through regular face-to-face, web and email-based correspondence. We communicate each child\u2019s progress through the use of a custom-designed \u2018progress report showing achievement toward or above benchmark over time. We host grade-level meetings, parent workshops, and send weekly grade-level newsletters that center on social, emotional, and academic well-being. The students feel a strong sense of community and school spirit through our dynamic Student Leadership groups. Exciting information is shared with our students regarding PAWsitive character events and incentives throughout the year via student-generated videos shown each Monday in Chapel . The administrative team is committed to building strong relationships with all professional community members. These strong relationships then foster a community in which we participate in seasonal and yearlong service learning . These service opportunities are intentionally tied to the social science, science, social justice standards, and social emotional curriculum while also using the themes in the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals . As a St. Margaret\u2019s alumni and parent, I can personally attest to the way our Lower School prepares students for the academic challenges of Middle School , Upper School and university life . Like our Middle School, we are careful to measure the success of our students in more significant ways than just through test scores. We measure our program and the needs of each child through various forms of assessment and use this data to drive instruction. Our program offers so much to foster the development of the whole child. Thank you for your interest in St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. Please feel welcome to contact us for additional information as you consider our Lower School program for your family.

St. Margaret\u2019s kindergarten classrooms launched its 2nd annual Lower School Watercolor Run last week, an event led by the kindergarten classes as part of their curriculum focus on Global Goal No. 3: Good Health and Wellbeing. Held on Chalmers Field, the run brought together students from across the Lower School to celebrate health, camaraderie, and community. Students and teachers ran laps around the field, cheered on by St. Margaret\u2019s community of students, teachers and parents, while being sprayed with bursts of vibrant color representing each of the school\u2019s four House Leagues. The colors symbolized the spirit of each House but also served as a unifying emblem\u2014reminding all participants that together, they are one Tartan community. Parents and families participated by dressing in their children\u2019s House League colors and were led in House chants by Lower School music teacher Zach Hanna. The entire Lower School community enjoyed popsicles after the run. The Lower School extends a huge thank you to kindergarten teachers Mara Balak, Gabriela Lopez and Jessica Banks; and personal fitness and wellness teachers Jennifer Cuda and Adam Doty for the year-long effort in planning for and producing the Watercolor Run.

St. Margaret\u2019s celebrated its grade 5 students this week with one of the Lower School\u2019s favorite traditions\u2014the ceremonial tossing of the Lower School red sweaters after the final Chapel of the school year. The celebratory event took place on the steps in front of the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts, adjacent to the Middle School they will soon call home. After a final Chapel honored the grade 5 students and their contributions to the Lower School, the Class of 2032 took a long route from the Chapel to Chalmers Field, passing by each Lower School grade as their parents and younger peers cheered them on. After one last photo with their traditional Lower School red sweaters, the grade 5 students took them off and in unison tossed them into the air. Congratulations to the students in the Class of 2032 as you celebrate this important milestone and prepare for Middle School!

Our Middle School program is designed to provide opportunities for students to engage in activities that support their growth as learners, leaders and compassionate members of the community who see the beauty and worth of all human beings. These three years are times of incredible growth for our students. Being surrounded by a community that cares for each other will build a sense of belonging and self-worth which will help them to think with their minds and their hearts throughout their lives. At St. Margaret\u2019s, we believe early adolescents should be exposed to a rich and vibrant program that enables them to explore challenges in diverse arenas. Our students thrive through their participation in academic , athletic , artistic and leadership programs . Small class sizes ensure that students are known and seen, which provides a safe and nurturing environment to have high academic expectations where taking intellectual risks are encouraged. Our enrichment program ensures all students are exposed to the full breadth of a liberal arts education and have the opportunity to pursue interests beyond the core curriculum. Watching our students grow through Upper School and successfully thrive in college and beyond provides us with continual feedback that our Middle School prepares students for the academic challenges of high school and university life. Yet, we are careful to measure the success of our students in more significant ways than test scores and grade-point averages. Although these are worthy goals and our students do quite well according to those measures, our program offers so much more to foster their development as people so that they can make their positive impact on others well after they leave St. Margaret\u2019s. With a focus on the education of the heart, the caring relationships with experienced faculty members help guide students towards the larger life lessons that will guide them throughout their lives. This critical aspect of our curriculum is certainly not delivered in the same manner as a math or English class. There is no textbook and no grade associated with these enduring lessons. They are delivered through authentic relationships, through learning from mistakes, through active self-reflection and mentoring conversations. Ultimately, our purpose is to work closely with students and their families to develop appropriate independence, resiliency and the skills necessary to pursue a meaningful life of learning, leadership and service. Thank you for your interest in St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. Please feel welcome to contact us for additional information as you consider our Middle School program for your family. Sincerely, Michael Allison Middle School Principal Middle School Creed We are committed to honesty, justice, and learning. We respect the dignity and worth of all human beings; their thoughts, feelings, and their individuality. We seek to celebrate and share the joy and creativity that emanate from the love of God. We strive to be responsible and contributing members of our families, our school community, and the world.

Our students thrive through their participation in academic, athletic, artistic, and leadership programs. Middle School Block Schedule The Middle School follows a patterned tumbling block schedule. Each block is 60 minutes long which allows for a variety of learning activities within the block. Breaks are spaced throughout the day so that students never meet for more than two blocks in a row on any given day. The weekly schedule also provides opportunities for the entire Middle School student body, grade levels, and advisory groups to meet each week. These \u201cCommunity Times\u201d are designed to build school culture, engage with our Episcopal identity, provide access to teachers during tutorials, gather grade levels together to talk about specific topics for their grade level, and for advisory groups to meet to focus on our social-emotional curriculum and diversity, equity and inclusion goals. The Middle and Upper Schools follow a similar weekly schedule enabling faculty to teach in both divisions as well as allowing Middle School students to accelerate, when appropriate, into Upper School courses. Middle School Leadership Middle School students are given many opportunities to demonstrate leadership. Opportunities range from formal, elected positions on the Middle School Student Council to student designed and led lunchtime clubs. The culture promotes and encourages student voice and engagement with the school experience. Middle School Service Learning Each grade level in St. Margaret\u2019s Middle School has established themes for its service learning focus of the year. The grade 6 theme is \u201cNavigate our environment.\u201d This theme is a focus of grade level class meetings as the team of sixth grade teachers helps our youngest Middle School students understand the logistics and culture of the Middle School. Their retreat day takes place off campus at the beach where students deepen their advisory bond with each other and their teachers, try new things and enjoy the Tartan community experience. In the fall the grade 6 students serve Second Harvest on the farm, support the all-Middle School project with Head Start Preschool and deepen their understanding and knowledge of the Tartan community and their family history through a cookbook project. The grade 7 theme is \u201cKnow and understand our community.\u201d As seventh graders work to develop their own identity, this theme provides students with opportunities to enhance their empathy and build the skills of cultural competency. With their focus on equity and hunger, the grade level will work with the local Head Start program, Capistrano Senior Living, our St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church and several other community partners. Their fall retreat will take place at the Irvine Spectrum and will allow for advisory groups to really enjoy some fun, quality bonding time together. The grade 8 theme is \u201cRespect the past and influence the future.\u201d Students work throughout the year to understand and support our troops and veterans. Work with our local Operation Help a Hero provides tangible experiences to connect with the needs of our current troops. Veterans Day presentations by local veterans and a project to interview a veteran further connect students to the importance of supporting our troops and honoring our veterans. Their fall retreat will be a day trip to Catalina where sunshine and adventure will pave the way for a fun day of community building. The end of the year class trip to Washington, D.C. provides a meaningful capstone experience. Middle School Chapel The Chapel service is integral to a St. Margaret\u2019s education. Our Episcopal tradition guides that regular participation in communal worship is the key to making individual spirituality blossom. Bringing our expansive diversity of backgrounds from each child into one unified presence in Chapel embraces our differences and creates the habits of prayer, compassion and devotion that are the foundations of worship to all views of a higher power we call God. Students are encouraged to participate in Chapel services in a variety of roles, including acolytes, readers, Eucharistic ministers and speakers. The Middle School attends Chapel services two times a week. Middle School Deans The structure of leadership in the Middle School provides for a dean at each grade level. These grade-level deans play a large role in the culture and communication for their respective grade levels. They organize and run class meetings, help with the cadence and events of advisory meetings, communicate regularly with teachers and students, and have a recognized and valuable voice with the Middle School administration. Due to their close relationship with the students and teachers in a given grade level, the deans are an important point of contact for students, parents, and teachers whenever the need might arise. Middle School Advisory The Middle School Advisory program is designed to provide each student with an adult mentor on campus who knows, cares for, and assists the student in navigating the academic, social and extracurricular experiences in the Middle School. These mixed-gender advisory groups will range in student size from 10-14 students. By being part of an advisory group, students have a guided opportunity to enhance their understanding of themselves, to expand relationships with other students, and to participate in programming that supports physical, social and emotional well-being. Middle School Clubs The Middle School has multiple teacher- and student-led clubs which meet during various lunch periods throughout the school year. These student-driven clubs provide students with the opportunity to organize and engage with an interested group of students. All clubs have a teacher as a support and guide, but the students themselves organize, lead and execute the club meetings. Middle School Tutorial Tutorial is a weekly period designed to allow students to meet with teachers to seek extra help or ask questions on classwork. Sometimes, teachers require students to attend tutorial to make up work, provide further guidance, and to check for content understanding. When students do not need individual time with a teacher, they are able to use tutorial to complete homework, study or work on long-term projects. To prepare students for the Upper School and life beyond, they are given increased freedom in how they choose to use their tutorial time as they progress through the Middle School.

Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens through formal and informal opportunities that work to advance justice on behalf of all members of our community and the world. In all aspects of their school lives, St. Margaret's students are provided leadership opportunities and are able to initiate, explore, and practice leadership skills in a safe and encouraging environment. Students are learning to become active and responsible citizens and leaders through formal and informal opportunities. Leadership development in our students is actively promoted across all divisions at the classroom, division and school-wide levels through a cohesive program of leadership opportunities and development at the school. Students have the opportunity to demonstrate leadership on the athletic field, on stage, in service, or to better the culture and climate of the school community. Leadership, however, is not just traditional class positions that students can fill each year. Students feel empowered to identify their own leadership opportunities. Students discover that leadership is about finding their voice, mobilizing others, humility, and working hard, among other things, and that these are skills that will set them up for a life of positive impact. St. Margaret\u2019s students do not sit passively, but rather demonstrate their character and actively seek ways to better themselves, our school community and beyond. Leadership opportunities are abundant across all divisions and are developmentally paced for increasing responsibility, decision-making and voice. Students practice and demonstrate leadership in deliberate and meaningful ways as they move through the divisions from Preschool to Upper School. They learn citizenship in the Preschool and understand the importance of helping a friend and being fair, rise to the opportunity to be big buddy in Lower School, create a student club in the Middle School or offer a powerful address on an important topic in Upper School Convocation and organize support around it. St. Margaret\u2019s students respond to issues and needs, and they engage with one another with respect and admiration and distinguish themselves among their peers and beyond the St. Margaret\u2019s campus.

This week, a group of grade 7 students stepped into the entrepreneurial spotlight, presenting their innovative business ideas to two seasoned entrepreneurs and former Shark Tank contestants. Manya Clark, cofounder of Tandm Surf, and Kressa Peterson, inventor of the Shower Toga, visited the campus as guest mentors for the school\u2019s signature \u201cTartan Tank\u201d program. The event, modeled after the popular television show Shark Tank, provided grade 7 students a platform to pitch product ideas developed over several weeks of research, collaboration, and design thinking. From sustainable consumer goods to tech-based solutions, each student team identified a problem and proposed a market-ready innovation to address it. Ms. Clark and Ms. Peterson offered real-world feedback and shared valuable insights into the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship. Their presence helped bring the classroom project to life and inspired students to refine their business strategies. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see such young minds already thinking like entrepreneurs,\u201d said Ms. Peterson, praising the students' creativity and commitment.

Brings Sleepy Hollow to Life at St. Margaret\u2019s 5/6/2025 The Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s showcased a vibrant cast of talented students and a skilled technical crew in a lively production blending humor, suspense, and a dash of theatrical flair. The Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s brought a spooky classic to the stage last week with the Middle School production of Ichabod! in the McGregor Family Theater. Adapted from Washington Irving\u2019s The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the play was directed by Middle School theater teacher Katie DeShan and assistant directed by Corinne Samskey, Middle and Upper School math teacher. Featuring a spirited cast of 40 students and a technical crew of 21, the production captured the eerie charm of Sleepy Hollow with humor, suspense, and a touch of fun swooning. \u201cThis play is not just about retelling a classic spooky tale,\u201d said Ms. DeShan. \u201cIt\u2019s about engaging with it together as a community.\u201d The immersive set, created by theater tech students under the guidance of Technical Director Gordon Richins and Production Assistant Justice Musick-Corson, transported audiences to the 1820s countryside. Lighting design by Gavin Shams (\u201926) and atmospheric sound effects including school bells, orchestral music in the style of Bridgerton, and well-timed shrieks added to the haunting ambiance. Austen Robertson (\u201929) starred as the quirky new schoolmaster Ichabod Crane, whose arrival in Sleepy Hollow set off a series of ghostly and comedic events. Reese Maciariello (\u201929) played the charming Katrina Van Tassel, while Jake Norton (\u201929) portrayed the mischievous Brom Bones, who kept Ichabod on edge with relentless pranks. The story was narrated by a chorus of students who added clever wordplay and wit to each scene. From choir rehearsals to spirited town gatherings, each moment on stage was filled with lively performances, sharp comedic timing, and creative character work. The period costumes, designed by Kirk Stefferud, and strong backstage leadership by student stage manager Soren Forer (\u201929) and assistant stage manager Rowan Harvey (\u201930), helped bring the production to life. Congratulations to the cast and crew of Ichabod! for an amazing production!

We are a school with a clear mission to educate the hearts and minds of young people for lives of learning, leadership and service. We are committed to knowing and loving each of our students as we guide them to discover passions, explore new pathways, establish healthy habits, and develop relationships that will nurture them throughout their Upper School experience and beyond. We are proud of our reputation as a school that combines a supportive, dynamic environment with high expectations, and we celebrate our students\u2019 extraordinary growth and accomplishments. Students arrive to the Upper School in the early years of adolescence, on the heels of grade 8, and leave as college freshmen, well prepared for the next step in their educational journey. During this transformation, we provide rich opportunities for the development of values, passions, and skills that lead to meaningful and successful lives. Curiosity, work ethic, resilience, empathy, creativity and kindness are skills and character traits we endeavor to grow and develop in these important formative years, because who our students are as people is as important as their academic success. The intimate size of the Upper School and faculty-student ratio allows for authentic and meaningful relationships to flourish between students and teachers. We offer a vigorous, relevant and innovative curriculum taught by expert faculty, of whom nearly 90 percent hold an advanced degree in their field. We offer a full range of honors and Advanced Placement courses to challenge and stretch our students in areas that are of interest to them, from humanities to STEAM courses. Courses such as software engineering, macroeconomics, multivariable calculus, wealth, poverty and ethics, and post AP Spanish allow students to individualize their program and pursue depth in areas of interest. Co-curricular opportunities are central to the St. Margaret\u2019s experience. We offer 24 varsity sports including football, cross country, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, volleyball, baseball and equestrian.

A glimpse into our everyday experience might include students and faculty sharing lunch in the Tartan Courtyard, a collaborative leadership meeting such as Peer Counselors, ASB or our Tartan Inclusivity and Diversity Education group where students and faculty meet to develop and execute programs that support our community. That same day, students may meet as an entire Upper School community for Convocation, also known as \u201cConvo,\u201d to hear students and faculty share important information, inspire others through a personal story and celebrate each other\u2019s accomplishments. They may also meet in an Advisory group which consists of 10 peers and a trusted faculty member who remain together throughout the four years of Upper School. In this space, they may discuss topics relevant to school and life beyond school or they may play a game and share a snack together. Our focus on service learning is ingrained in our school community, and endeavors to create meaningful relationships, contributions and lasting impact. Students work in advisory groups on special days built into the schedule to partner with local non-profit organizations that they choose, and build an ongoing relationship to support and serve their unique organizational needs. Students complete their service requirement during the school day. There is much to share about the St. Margaret\u2019s Upper School and we look forward to conversations with you about how our \u201ceveryday\u201d Tartan experience might be a right fit for you and your family.

St. Margaret\u2019s seniors Tori Clark, Helena Lawry, and Tessa Maryott were honored this week at Upper School Convocation, as they have committed to continue studying their arts specialty in college. \u201cThe Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s would like to recognize students who have maintained their commitment to an arts discipline throughout their time here and are committed to pursue this art discipline at the university level for the next four years. This is an extraordinary achievement to be accepted to these schools to continue their arts education,\u201d said Director of the Arts Dan Pacheco. The students recognized: Tori Clark, who plans to attend Connecticut College majoring in Dance and Psychology. St. Margaret\u2019s Dance Director Kirsten Harvey shared affirming words about Tori: \u201cWhat makes Tori a standout dance student isn\u2019t just her ability to master choreography, but her genuine love for dance. Whether in rehearsal or in performance, Tori approaches each movement with thoughtfulness and purpose. She possesses an innate understanding of the emotional power of dance, using it as a means of expression and connection. It\u2019s this rare combination of skill and emotional depth that makes her such an incredible dancer.\u201d Helena Lawry, who plans to attend University of Colorado Boulder majoring in Fine Arts. Jesse Standlea, visual arts teacher, remarked, \u201cShe has been a passionate, creative, self-motivated student. She has found strength in the creative act.

Our mission, core values, and DEI work are rooted in our Episcopal identity, which calls us to seek God in and honor the dignity of every human being. Our Equity and Inclusion core value compels us: We embrace and celebrate the identity of every human being, and advocate for equity, inclusion, and justice. We aim to create an environment at St. Margaret\u2019s where every Tartan is known and loved for who they are and who they are fully. Fostering that environment requires continued strategic planning, captured through our innovation strategy, accreditation focus areas, and yearly DEI priorities. List of 3 items. What do we mean by Diversity? We recognize and celebrate that diversity exists in the backgrounds and experiences that have shaped our lives. Diversity encompasses the complexity of the human experience: our life experiences, our journeys through the world, the faiths we observe, the traditions we practice, the structures of our families, our socioeconomic statuses, the languages we speak, the colors of our skin, our abilities, our physical, social, emotional, and spiritual needs, and the list goes on. These myriad intersecting identities shape us as individuals, in groups, and in our school community. At St. Margaret\u2019s, we are proud that our Tartans\u2019 many backgrounds, life experiences, and identities weave together to form a wonderful fabric that unites us and prepares our students for living in a complex global society. What do we mean by Inclusion? By inclusion, we mean our ability to honor and respect the dignity of every human being. Inclusion means that when Tartans walk onto campus, they can bring their full selves each and every day. Each of our backgrounds, perspectives, and social identifiers belong here\u2014fully and without exception. I am my full self. I belong. When we engage in inclusion work, we ask ourselves, \u201cIs every member of our community able to co-create the culture of our school? Whose voices and experiences are included? Whose are not?\u201d \u201cBeing seen, valued and loved for who you are by nurturing adults and peers is the rich soil in which a young person flourishes and thrives. We have a wonderfully diverse community of people who come from many cultures, backgrounds and experiences. We want every Tartan to feel they belong here. At its most fundamental level, DEI work is love work. It is about ensuring that every member of our community is known and experiences a sense of belonging,\u201d says Director of Equity and Inclusion Victor Cota. What do we mean by Equity? Whenever and wherever we find that certain voices and experiences are less represented than others, that is when our equity work kicks in. We understand that ours is a world of imbalanced access to opportunities and resources. As a result, people in the same community will have very different experiences. When we engage in equity work, we ask ourselves, \u201cWho is favored? Who is not? Who has privilege in this situation? Who does not?\u201d Then, as we become more comfortable and informed, we ask, \u201cWhat will we do about it?\u201d Sometimes this means reflecting on individual behaviors and sometimes it means examining entire systems. What matters is that we recognize that inequity exists, work to identify it, and ask the questions to fully understand it, move through any subsequent discomfort, and act. At St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School, we are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. List of 1 members.

St. Margaret\u2019s professional community engaged in an in-service day on Tuesday centered around joy in diversity, equity and inclusion work at the school. St. Margaret\u2019s Equity Team, led by Director of Equity and Inclusion Victor Cota, organized an engaging in-service day designed to meaningfully explore St. Margaret\u2019s core value of Equity and Inclusion . The day started with insightful presentations to the entire professional community. The first was a panel by Special Camp which featured camp staff, counselors and campers. Special Camp is a program for youth with disabilities which strives to provide an unforgettable summer experience while eliminating the stigma commonly associated with the disabled community. It is sponsored and hosted by St. Margaret\u2019s, and Upper School students were among the counselors who shared their experience working with campers in a one-to-one camper-to-counselor format. Three Upper School students also presented, sharing the work being done by the Tartan Inclusion and Diversity Education (TIDE) student leadership group around the upcoming election. That included two recent student-led TIDEtalks designed to encourage respectful and civil discussion around a number of policies being discussed within the national discourse. Afterward, professional community members could choose from a number of different workshops centered around joy in DEI work. It included a panel conducted by TIDE students, who spoke of their experience and took questions from professional community members about TIDE. Other options touched on different topics within this core value, including sessions on implementing restorative practices, supporting neurodiverse students, teaching mindfulness practices, and joining optional affinity groups where communities of professional community members could come together and discuss their shared experiences.

Upper School seniors in English IV: The Color Line class are studying the great writers, thinkers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance. As part of the class, taught by Upper School English teacher and DEI coordinator Jamie Bunch, the grade 12 students recently led a poetry circle with grade 8 English students in celebration of Black History Month. During several class periods last week, the Upper School students visited the Middle School classrooms of English teachers Dr. Daniel Matlock and Dr. Rachel Mykkanen to read and discuss the works of Langston Hughes. Upper School students provided the grade 8 English students with historical context about the Harlem Renaissance as well as pertinent details about the life of Langston Hughes. Then, the groups of Middle School students cycled through different five- to seven-minute poetry circles centered around one poem and facilitated by the Upper School students. A few of the Langston Hughes poems the students discussed were, \u201cI, Too,\u201d \u201cI Look at the World,\u201d and \u201cHarlem.\u201d The cross-divisional lesson offered an opportunity for reflection, journaling and positive discussion on the historical context of both Langston Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance. English IV: The Color Line is one of several semester-long seminars that Upper School seniors choose from which examine a particular aspect of literature.

St. Margaret\u2019s welcomed educators, academic leaders and curriculum specialists for the 2nd annual St. Margaret\u2019s Summer Institute, an engaging professional development experience grounded in constructivist theory, place-based learning and transdisciplinary approaches. Over two days, attendees immersed in experiential education and the foundations for bringing this approach to learning into the classroom. The first day included a deep-dive into experiential education, featuring two engaging activities that took place at nearby Doheny State Beach. The workshops included: Oceans of Wonder: Perception, Place, and the Natural World - An immersive workshop that explored the sometimes complementary and sometimes contradictory ways humans come to know the natural world\u2014by observation and engagement, inquiry and imagination, through labor and leisure, science and study. Waves of Belonging: Surfing, Subjectivity, and Stories - The experiential workshop explored the intersection of identity and collective memory through the lens of Southern California surf culture. Participants examined how the ocean\u2014and the stories told around it\u2014shapes who we are, who we imagine ourselves to be, and what we choose to forget. Participants also explore how innovation, entrepreneurship, and consumerism have driven surf culture, from aerospace-influenced board design to the rise of a billion-dollar industry built on the image of freedom and rebellion. While set in the beautiful coastal environment of Southern California, the learning was designed to transcend location, allowing attendees to take powerful principles back to their classrooms no matter where they teach. The second day featured a workshop led by Dr. Jackie Grennon-Brooks, Professor Emerita at Hofstra University and co-founder of the Long Island Explorium in Port Jefferson, N.Y. Dr. Grennon Brooks led a workshop exploring sand and water play, exploring natural materials and tackling challenges that mirror the dynamic learning environments of each student.

School leaders have been hard at work this year constructing a new Strategic Plan for St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. The Strategic Plan will be finalized this summer. It will mark the end of a three-prong process that has involved the entire school community over the past year. Here\u2019s a closer look: Feedback and Data St. Margaret\u2019s has solicited feedback from parents, students and alumni through anonymous surveys this school year, in addition to feedback from the local community, idea-generating exercises at PTF General Membership Meetings and PTF Executive Board Meetings, and the completion of a market research report to better understand St. Margaret\u2019s positioning in the educational landscape. This feedback was influential in identifying strategic directions that the school community is eager to pursue, which was aggregated and presented to St. Margaret\u2019s Strategic Plan steering committee, a 21-member team made up of Trustees, school leaders, faculty, staff, students and parents. Engagement The pillars of St. Margaret\u2019s new Strategic Plan were further developed through a number of engagement opportunities. A professional community in-service day in January was dedicated to generate ideas and clarify focus areas. The Board of Trustees has dived into strategic-plan work at an October retreat and during several meetings, including multiple Board long-range planning committee meetings. Design In designing a Strategic Plan to present to the Board of Trustees, the 34-member design team divided into eight groups, where they had several meetings to talk through ideas and feedback and to collectively craft initiative proposals for consideration. These proposals were aggregated and discussed at a final steering committee meeting in early May, before a final draft was put together and presented to the Board of Trustees. Next Steps The Board of Trustees met in May to review the Strategic Plan draft and offer feedback. The plan will undergo a series of revisions before it is finalized and adopted by the Board of Trustees this summer. The new Strategic Plan will be shared with the St. Margaret\u2019s school community soon after.

Campaigne 5/30/2025 Dr. Jeneen Graham, Head of School We are saddened the share the news of the passing of Markham B. Campaigne, St. Margaret\u2019s Headmaster from 1986 to 2003. Dear St. Margaret\u2019s Community, I\u2019m deeply saddened to share the news of the passing of Markham B. Campaigne on Wednesday, May 28. Mr. Campaigne served as Headmaster at St. Margaret\u2019s from 1986 to 2003, and remains the longest-serving head in school history. His loss is immense and will be felt throughout the St. Margaret\u2019s community, as we take time to reflect on his remarkable life and his immeasurable contributions to our school. Mr. Campaigne was instrumental in St. Margaret\u2019s growth and transformation into the leading independent school that it is today. Under his leadership, St. Margaret\u2019s student body doubled in size to its current level of more than 1,200 students. The campus footprint grew to nearly 20 acres during his tenure, including the addition of space that became the Early School and the Performing Arts Center. Mr. Campaigne was proud of St. Margaret\u2019s growth, remarking that \u201ctogether we have built a world-class school while remaining true to our spiritual, caring and integrity-based roots.\u201d Yet Mr. Campaigne\u2019s legacy is just as evident in the lives he impacted over his many years in education. He was a beloved school leader who had a reputation for listening carefully to faculty, staff, students, parents and Trustees. He showed an unwavering support for the arts and athletics, and was a constant presence at school activities and events. A total of 748 students graduated from St. Margaret\u2019s during his tenure, and Mr. Campaigne was frequently present at alumni reunions and school events as recently as last year, catching up with former students, faculty and staff who were always so happy to see him. Mr. Campaigne was a pillar of the St. Margaret\u2019s community and one of the most influential figures in the history of our school. We will miss him, yet we will remember his visionary leadership, his thoughtfulness, his strong faith and his love and care for the Tartan community. Please join me in expressing our love and prayers to the Campaigne family, including wife Mary Ann and their four children who all graduated from St. Margaret\u2019s\u2014Mark Jr. \u201987, Dann \u201990, Sarah \u201900 and Deborah \u201902. We will share more information on Mr. Campaigne\u2019s remarkable legacy, as well as plans for a memorial service, in the days to follow. Sincerely, Jeneen D. Graham, Ed. D.

In a powerful display of cross-divisional collaboration and real-world learning, Upper School students in AP Environmental Science presented interactive lessons to Lower School students this week, uniting education with the Global Goals that guide Lower School learning and service. The Global Goals seek to engage students in solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing challenges ranging from climate action to responsible consumption. St. Margaret\u2019s has embraced this call to action by integrating Global Goals-focused themes across its Lower School curriculum. Each Lower School grade explores one core goal throughout the academic year. These themes become the foundation for the AP Environmental Science students' final project, in which they design and teach engaging, age-appropriate lessons to Lower School students in grades 1-3. Leading up to this week\u2019s presentations, APES students worked in teams to research their assigned Global Goal, identify connections to their curriculum, and develop a dynamic, student-centered lesson tailored to their partner class. The process included observing Lower School classrooms, interviewing students and planning alongside Lower School teachers to ensure developmental appropriateness. The resulting projects were as creative as they were educational. Examples included: a hands-on science investigation examining how sea level rise is affected by the location of melting ice on land versus in the ocean, in addition to an energetic recycling relay race to reinforce concepts of waste management and sustainability, followed by an interactive simulations of managing a sustainable farm, and constructing sustainable cities using LEGO blocks to explore urban planning and environmental impact.

Grade 5 students in spiritual practice recently concluded their study of labyrinths with a reflective walk through St. Margaret\u2019s own 11-circuit medieval-style labyrinth, located in the Chapel courtyard. Built in 2012 from brick and measuring 39 feet in diameter, the labyrinth offers students a firsthand connection to an ancient spiritual practice. As part of the unit, students explored the history and significance of labyrinths, learning that, unlike a maze, a labyrinth follows a single, winding path to the center and back. The design is not meant to confuse, but rather to encourage mindfulness, walking meditation, and quiet reflection. Throughout the study, grade 5 students located the labyrinth on the world-wide labyrinth locator and researched similar structures around the world. The unit lesson culminated in a personal walking experience, where each student found unique meaning in the journey. One student shared that she used the time to say prayers for loved ones. Another reflected on gratitude, mentally listing things he\u2019s thankful for. A third student said the walk helped him let go of his worries and focus on the present moment. \u201cIt was especially meaningful to observe how the experience resonated uniquely with each student\u2014reflecting the true beauty of the labyrinth: it meets each individual exactly where they are,\u201d said Jessie Akers, Lower School spiritual practice teacher.

A beloved corner of St. Margaret\u2019s campus is experiencing new life this spring. The Early School Garden, nestled beside the Darcy Rice Center for the Arts parking lot, has undergone a thoughtful redesign\u2014one that brings both innovation and inspiration to the school\u2019s youngest learners. The transformation reflects the Early School\u2019s commitment to hands-on, nature-based education, rooted in the Reggio Emilia philosophy and a constructivist approach to learning. The refreshed space includes a newly installed iron trellis that marks the entrance to the school's garden, also featuring a newly constructed \u201cchicken condo,\u201d a large, carefully designed coop where Early School students may observe and care for live chickens. Alongside it, a new water feature, improved accessible pathways, and raised flower beds create an engaging environment for Early School students to explore. A new greenhouse was built in the Garden last school year as part of a PTF grant. Early School students are provided an opportunity to engage in a range of activities in the Garden: measuring soil, tracking the growth of seedlings, designing signage, and studying insect habitats. These immersive experiences are integrated into the broader curriculum, reinforcing skills across disciplines. From identifying patterns in seeds to observing how plants respond to watering, St. Margaret\u2019s youngest Tartans are developing foundational scientific thinking in the Garden. The Early School educators emphasize that time spent learning and playing outdoors supports holistic child development\u2014cognitive, social-emotional, and physical. In this setting, the Early School garden serves as a dynamic co-teacher, fostering curiosity, persistence and critical thinking. \u201cThe collaborative nature of gardening builds a culture of care and belonging, as children take turns watering, harvesting, and feeding the hens,\u201d said Erika Garcia, Early School outdoor and motor development teacher. \u201cThese shared responsibilities foster a sense of interdependence and strengthen classroom relationships.\u201d In addition, the harvests from the garden often end up in the Early School\u2019s demonstration lab, where children prepare recipes using their own produce. \u201cPlanting with purpose allows children to witness the full life cycle of plants from tiny seeds to thriving plants, and with that comes powerful lessons,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cWhen children carefully place seeds in the soil, tend to them each day, and observe them grow, they are learning about responsibility, patience, and care. And when it comes time to harvest, we often hear proud declarations like, \u2018I grew this!\u2019\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

St. Margaret's Episcopal School is pleased to announce the appointment of Megan Good and Ryan Thompson as co-head coaches of the Tartan cross country program. Coach Good, a member of St. Margaret's track & field and cross country coaching staff since 2022, competed in both sports at Montana State University. At St. Margaret's, Good has served as a grade 7 advisor, Middle School Personal Fitness and Wellness coach, and is the athletic department's transportation coordinator.

We hope to build on that foundation, keep the bar high, and continue pushing this team to achieve the highest success this sport has to offer.\" Good and Thompson were instrumental in guiding St. Margaret's athletes to back-to-back girls cross country CIF Championships in 2024 and 2023, as well as boys cross country's CIF Runners-Up finishes in 2022 and 2024. At state competitions, the Tartans had top ten finishes in 2021 and 2022. Coach Thompson has also worked with Tartan track & field distance athlete and CIF Champions Jackson Adelman (2021 1600M) and Everett Capelle (2024 1600M). \"Coach Good and Coach Thompson were both elite high school runners in Southern California and went on to decorated collegiate careers. Although their running accomplishments and understanding of training principals are impressive, it is their focus on how strong team culture leads to success that solidified their selection,\" said St. Margaret's Director of Athletics Dan O'Shea. \"We are excited for this new era of Tartan cross country and look forward to the continued success of this highly accomplished program.\" Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

Brings Sleepy Hollow to Life at St. Margaret\u2019s 5/6/2025 The Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s showcased a vibrant cast of talented students and a skilled technical crew in a lively production blending humor, suspense, and a dash of theatrical flair. The Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s brought a spooky classic to the stage last week with the Middle School production of Ichabod! in the McGregor Family Theater. Adapted from Washington Irving\u2019s The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the play was directed by Middle School theater teacher Katie DeShan and assistant directed by Corinne Samskey, Middle and Upper School math teacher. Featuring a spirited cast of 40 students and a technical crew of 21, the production captured the eerie charm of Sleepy Hollow with humor, suspense, and a touch of fun swooning. \u201cThis play is not just about retelling a classic spooky tale,\u201d said Ms. DeShan. \u201cIt\u2019s about engaging with it together as a community.\u201d The immersive set, created by theater tech students under the guidance of Technical Director Gordon Richins and Production Assistant Justice Musick-Corson, transported audiences to the 1820s countryside. Lighting design by Gavin Shams (\u201926) and atmospheric sound effects including school bells, orchestral music in the style of Bridgerton, and well-timed shrieks added to the haunting ambiance. Austen Robertson (\u201929) starred as the quirky new schoolmaster Ichabod Crane, whose arrival in Sleepy Hollow set off a series of ghostly and comedic events. Reese Maciariello (\u201929) played the charming Katrina Van Tassel, while Jake Norton (\u201929) portrayed the mischievous Brom Bones, who kept Ichabod on edge with relentless pranks. The story was narrated by a chorus of students who added clever wordplay and wit to each scene. From choir rehearsals to spirited town gatherings, each moment on stage was filled with lively performances, sharp comedic timing, and creative character work. The period costumes, designed by Kirk Stefferud, and strong backstage leadership by student stage manager Soren Forer (\u201929) and assistant stage manager Rowan Harvey (\u201930), helped bring the production to life. Congratulations to the cast and crew of Ichabod! for an amazing production!

Fifteen Upper School Tartan dancers had the exciting opportunity to perform at Disneyland as part of a special collaboration with Dance the Magic, an organization dedicated to turning performance dreams into reality for dancers around the world. In preparation for the performance, the dancers learned parade choreography from a professional Disney choreographer. The routine was recorded and sent to Director of Dance, Kirsten Harvey, who worked closely with the students to bring the choreography to life. Upon arriving in Anaheim on the two-day experience, the dancers spent time together at Downtown Disney. On the morning of the performance, Tartan dancers enjoyed a special brunch at the Grand Californian Hotel, took individual and group photos with a professional photographer, and finally spent time with Jennilee Barr, professional Disney choreographer to rehearse the final touches on their parade performance. The dancers experienced the opportunity to learn skills from a professional choreographer such as rehearsal protocol and performance etiquette. Dressed in their vibrant teal costumes, the dancers headed backstage to prepare for their parade down Main Street, U.S.A. As the gates opened at the center of the park, the dancers stepped onto the parade route performing alongside other dancers from across the U.S. and Australia. The students entertained the crowd with a lively routine set to the fan-favorite Lilo & Stitch song, Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride. Their hard work and dedication culminated in a magical performance, showcasing their talent and school spirit on one of the world\u2019s most iconic stages. \u201cThis experience gave St. Margaret\u2019s students a glimpse into the life of a professional dancer\u2014an unforgettable opportunity that will surely become a core memory as they continue through their Upper School years,\u201d said Mrs. Harvey.

The Early School was transformed into a marvelous showcase of student learning on Thursday, as the 7th annual WOW Night brought families to St. Margaret\u2019s for a celebration of the meaningful play-based learning that took place throughout the school year. Families are invited to WOW, or Works of Wonder, an annual event in the Early School for an opportunity to see student work and student-led projects. Families visited classrooms, the atelier (art studio), the Demonstration Lab and the Outdoor Classroom. \u201cChildren\u2019s learning unfolds through inquiry, play, and collaboration and WOW Night serves as a powerful tool to make children\u2019s learning visible, showcasing how they synthesize their knowledge and ideas,\u201d said Early School Director Dr. Cris Lozon. This child-centered approach lies at the core of educational philosophy, evident in the documentation showcased in each classroom and Outdoor Classroom. The documentation not only makes the children\u2019s learning visible to others but also empowers the children to take ownership of their learning journey. Dr. Lozon emphasized the valuable influence Early School students had preparing for WOW night, \u201cThe WOW exhibit was not just a display of learning but a creation shaped by the children\u2019s ideas. Through their voices and contributions, they built, curated, and defined the landscape, making their perspective an essential part of the experience.\u201d The Early School students also practiced their docent skills with their peers. Then, later in the morning they practiced again with the professional community. By the evening they were well prepared for their families. The displays in each classroom differ and represent various academic disciplines, encompassing math, literacy, as well as engineering and scientific thinking. Students moved excitedly between classrooms with their families, eager to show off the wondrous learning that took place during the year. With community and fellowship, attendees enjoyed food and refreshments, reconnecting with families and interacting with the Early School\u2019s expert faculty. St. Margaret\u2019s Early School is a play- and researched-based academic program with roots in constructivist teaching and the renowned Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education.

The Crystal Cove tide pools in Laguna Beach turned into an exciting outdoor classroom for Grade 2 students, who embarked on an educational journey blending science, social studies, and climate action. The Lower School students were joined by Upper School Marine Science students, providing a deeper understanding of the local environment and the ways in which tide pool creatures have adapted to survive in their unique habitats. The day\u2019s activities were the culmination of months of collaboration between the grade 2 students and their Upper School peers, who had recently completed their own study of the intertidal zone. In February, the Upper School Marine Science students traveled to Dana Point to explore tide pools, studying organisms across the various zones of the intertidal zone\u2014splash, high, mid, and low tide zones. Upper School marine science students were then tasked with presenting their findings and teaching grade 2 students about the animals and plants that thrive in these rocky environments. A series of engaging presentations from the Upper School Marine Science students included designed interactive models showcasing how tide pool animals adapt to the ever-changing conditions of their environment. From the tough, resilient sea anemones to the clever blue-banded hermit crabs, students learned about fascinating adaptations that help these creatures survive. Grade 2 students discovered aggregating anemones, blue-banded hermit crabs, Pacific mussels, gooseneck barnacles, among other fascinating marine animals, sea grasses, and kelp species. This experience enriched the marine science students' knowledge of the rocky intertidal zone. In addition to the presentations, Grade 2 students participated in a variety of interactive stations that tied in with both their science and social studies curriculum, focusing on landforms and climate action. One station allowed grade 2 students to build landforms in the sand, using their imagination to create mountains, valleys, and rivers while discussing the principles of erosion and weathering led by grade 2 teachers. \u201cThe students were thrilled to create islands complete with plateaus and valleys, learning firsthand about how these features are formed over time by the forces of nature,\u201d said grade 2 teacher Maclay Gallman. In another station led by David Beshk, Lower School science teacher, the students portrayed the role of scientists examining the different types of sand, seaweed, and organisms found within the seaweed using sifters and magnifying glasses. The field trip also provided an important opportunity to discuss climate action and environmental responsibility. In the weeks leading up to the trip, the grade 2 students read books about climate change and the impact of plastic pollution on the ocean. They learned about the importance of keeping the beaches clean and protecting marine ecosystems. Students even created two public service announcements (PSAs), which were shared during Chapel in the Lower School. The PSAs focused on the effects of plastic on the environment and offered actionable tips for reducing waste and protecting the planet. During the field trip, the students participated in a beach clean-up, collecting trash such as plastic bottles, straws, and bags. Their efforts tied in with their classroom lessons about climate action and showed them how small actions can make a big difference in protecting the environment. As the day came to a close, the grade 2 students reflected on their experiences with a sense of accomplishment. \u201cIt was a beautiful, educational, and fun day at the Crystal Cove tide pools,\u201d said Mrs. Gallman. The outdoor learning experience not only reinforced key concepts from their curriculum but also instilled a sense of environmental stewardship and a deeper appreciation for the natural world.

St. Margaret's boys lacrosse program picked up a convincing 11-9 home win against long-time rival Foothill High School Saturday afternoon on Tartan Field. The No. 12 Tartans and No. 6 Knights continued a legacy of exciting contests in a non-league battle Saturday with underdog St. Margaret's trailing 0-1 until Aston Frankfort (3g, 1a) tied it at 4:20 in the first. St. Margaret's pressed the attack, rattling off 3 unanswered goals in just over 2 minutes. The Knights fought back, knotting it a 3-3 to end the first quarter. The Tartans opened the second quarter on the front foot, increasing their lead to 7-3 until Foothill finally found the net at 4:17 left in the half. A gritty back-and-forth struggle ensued, with St. Margaret's taking a healthy 8-5 lead into halftime. The second half was much of the same for the Tartans as they held Foothill scoreless to head into the final frame leading 10-5. Foothill wasn't done yet, staging a late rally in the fourth, closing to within 2 goals with an 11-9 Tartan lead with 3:40 left to play in the game. A few needless penalties charged to the Knights and a clutch save by Tartan goaltender George Knapp (16 saves) kept St. Margaret's on top through the final whistle. Andrew Toubin led the Tartans with 5 points on 3 goals and 2 assists while Ben Greek (2g), Cob Sprague (1g, 1a) and Ryan Kees (1g) supported. Defenseman Reece Ballard contributed a long-pole goal in the win.

Grade 3 students took part in a hands-on, on-campus composting learning event, furthering their understanding of ecology and waste reduction in a fun, interactive way. The event, led by the experts from weCompost2, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting climate change through onsite composting and community education, was the perfect tie-in for the Lower School students\u2019 Ecology Center field trips and the waste-free lunch initiative recently. The students were introduced to the fascinating world of composting with a lively \u201ccompostable or not?\u201d sorting game, which challenged them to determine which materials may be ideal for composting. The game was both educational and engaging, connecting important concepts about waste and sustainability. One of the highlights of the day was learning about the role of worms in the composting process. Grade 3 students explored worm farming, observing how these tiny creatures break down organic matter to create nutrient-rich soil. Each student also created their own mini worm bin, complete with two live worms, which they took home as part of their new journey as certified worm farmers. As grade 3 students explored the benefits of composting and waste reduction, the lesson naturally extended beyond the classroom and into their everyday habits. \u201cWhile waste-free lunches weren\u2019t the focus of the workshop, it was the perfect time to connect these ideas and encourage students to reduce food waste at lunchtime, too!\u201d remarked Penny Mateer, grade 3 teacher.

The Space Exploration Exhibit is a cross-divisional collaborative project between St. Margaret\u2019s Upper School astronomy students and grade 3 science students. The Space Exploration Exhibit displays hand-built physical models of past, present, and future space missions, and is specifically designed for Lower School students to spark curiosity about the vast universe, invoke a sense of wonder about the unknown, and highlight the process of scientific discovery. The project was developed through an Innovation Summer Grant where teachers spend time over the summer working on innovative projects designed to enrich and elevate the student learning experience through experiential and interdisciplinary learning, the integration of emerging technologies into the curriculum, or creating opportunities for cross-divisional collaboration. The exhibit featured models of various targets in the Solar System which humans have explored or will explore with scientific instrumentation on spacecrafts. The astronomy students created models of the mission targets like planets, asteroids or moons that illustrate the key scientific questions or discoveries of their selected space mission. The grade 3 students engineered small replicas of the mission-specific spacecraft. Leading up to the exhibit, both Upper School astronomy students and grade 3 science students read books about the planets and created and played with spinning planet tops to illustrate planet rotation. The cross-divisional collaboration sparks more than just curiosity; it also ignites an opportunity to engage with each other as Lower School science teacher David Beshk explains, \u201cDr. Stephanie Capen and I were discussing our space and solar system units we each taught. The idea of collaboration was born from those conversations. We thought it would be engaging and memorable if we could have our students work together on a space exploration unit of study.\u201d Upper School astronomy students began the project by conducting research on past, present, or future space missions such as Europa Clipper, Artemis, Cassini and New Horizons to name a few. The Upper School astronomy students put together mission research briefs highlighting the type of mission, key facts about the mission target, and what students discovered or hoped to discover as a result of the space mission. The mission research briefs were delivered to Lower School science teacher Mr. Beshk's classroom, as part of the next phase. Grade 3 students were the engineers who designed a small replica of the spacecraft. The Upper School and grade 3 students' opportunity to build relationships through the study of astronomy highlights St. Margaret\u2019s unique preK-12 campus. \u201cThis is one of the biggest blessings we have at St. Margaret\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Beshk said. The culmination of all the research, designing, building, and playing launched the Space Exploration Exhibit into a valuable experience. The Lower School classes walked through the exhibit with the opportunity to see and touch the models, while discovering and stimulating more interest about astronomy and the Solar System. Mr. Beshk remarks, \u201cThe exhibit enhances the experience in many ways. First, it brings Upper School and Lower School students together around a common topic. This creates conversations and fosters memorable relationships. Additionally, it creates cross-divisional collaboration that sparks creativity and a sense of teamwork between Lower School grade 3 Students and Upper School students.\u201d The Space Exploration Exhibit will be on display in the Lower School Science Lab at the upcoming STEAM Expo on Saturday, May 10.

St. Margaret\u2019s is making significant progress in the development of a new Strategic Plan to shape the future direction of the school. Over the course of this school year, the Strategic Plan Steering Committee\u2014made up of Trustees, professional community members, alumni and Upper School students\u2014has been hard at work establishing initial strategic initiatives, emerging goals and proposed strategies based on community feedback, market research and more. The Steering Committee is now divided into eight groups, each tasked with researching and developing action plans in their assigned goals. The teams are responsible for further refining and detailing the implementation of strategic goals, including timelines and metrics for success. These preliminary plans will be submitted in April and refined by the Steering Committee before being presented to the Board of Trustees later this spring. As part of the feedback process, St. Margaret\u2019s Head of School Dr. Jeneen Graham presented at the most recent PTF General Membership Meeting. There, she shared an update on the Strategic Plan timeline before leading parents in attendance in an exercise to solicit further feedback. Parents were given six strategic ideas that had consistently emerged during the process and were tasked with ranking them in order of importance from their perspective. Parents and other members of the school community had the chance to take part in a strategic planning survey earlier in the process to identify priorities. The Strategic Plan will be finalized this summer, at which point it will be shared with the St. Margaret\u2019s community.

St. Margaret's surf program sent a talented contingent to the Scholastic Surf Series Individual State Championship at Oceanside Harbor South Jetty on March 24. Braeden Nock delivered an impressive performance, finishing 5th overall in the Men's Longboard division. The morning heats provided ideal conditions with offshore winds and a steady swell, allowing Nock to dominate, taking first in his opening two heats. As the tide dropped and the wind shifted onshore during the semifinals, the conditions became more challenging, but he pushed through to secure his spot in the final. The championship heat showcased extraordinary surfing from the top longboarders in the state. Nock previously competed at State as a sophomore but missed last year's competition due to an injury that sidelined him for most of the season. Coach Jen Cuda reflected on his return, sharing, \"Seeing Braeden back in the water this season has been such a joy. His natural competitive spirit, combined with his smooth style, always makes for an exciting heat. It's clear how much he enjoys surfing, and I couldn't be happier to see him doing what he loves again.\" Sophomore Brendan Lyons also performed outstandingly, securing multiple first-place finishes in his early heats. During the repechage heat, one of Brendan's waves had the entire beach cheering as he posted the highest single-wave score of the heat. Lyons narrowly missed qualifying for the finals by just two-tenths of a point. \"Watching Brendan progress this year has been so exciting. From winning our school competitions to succeeding in events outside of school, he has continued to push himself and improve. Brendan is always seen cheering on his fellow competitors, representing our team's spirit,\" said coach Grant Richey. \"Congratulations on a stellar year\u2014we can't wait to see what's next!\" Congratulations to all the Tartan competitors who qualified for State this year. Juniors Logan Cuda and Ry O Hill, sophomores Ethan Lavender and Gareth Thomas, and freshmen Colt Ettwein and Chloe Eskander all had strong morning heats, with Lavender and Cuda advancing to the second round. With a talented and determined group of athletes, this young team is excited to celebrate their season and start preparing for an even stronger showing next year!

It is a great way to build relationships through reading.\u201d Mrs. Magana coaches the St. Margaret\u2019s teams alongside Lower School teachers Colleen Beshk and Lauren Johnson.

The Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s presented the Upper School musical, Alice by Heart, in the Marcus D. Hurlbut Theater last week. A talented cast of 22 Upper School students told a reimagined version of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland in this story about resilience, imagination and the power of finding escape in the imaginary worlds we create. This production was set in the depths of World War II in a London tube station. The set design by Gordon Richins, technical director and resident designer, transported audiences to the Underground setting that serves as a makeshift bomb shelter in the story. The refugees in the shelter use storytelling to navigate grief and fear. They escape through their imagination, and into the absurdity of Lewis Carroll\u2019s world filled with nonsense, humor and playful language. According to Daniel Pacheco, director of performing arts and department chair, \u201cThis production has been a journey of exploration \u2013 into the whimsical, the heartbreaking, and the beautifully strange. Our cast and crew of 38 students have worked tirelessly to bring this world to life. It is a reminder that in moments of darkness, we can turn to stories not just to escape, but to heal.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

In further sharing the importance of service as part of St. Margaret\u2019s mission, Upper School junior Nick Fox shared his involvement in the Moseley Venture to Serve, as he helped organize a golf tournament which raised money for Special Camp. \u201cIf you blend the things you love with the things you care about, you can start leading a life of service,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have had the chance to lead this project, and I am proud of St. Margaret\u2019s for being a place that teaches us the importance of leading lives of service.\u201d The All-School Spring Service also included beautiful music\u2014performances of \u201cStand By Me\u201d by St. Margaret\u2019s choral and orchestra students, and the hymn \u201cI Sing a Song of the Saints of God\u201d which was also played when St. Margaret\u2019s first opened in 1979. As the All-School Spring Service coincided with the first day of spring and Nowruz, two Upper School students spoke of the Persian New Year and wished students a Happy Nowruz and happy first day of spring, inviting students to visit haftseen tables set up in each of the divisions. The ceremony concluded with a prayer for the Class of 2025 by Head of School Dr. Jeneen Graham, as the senior class prepares for the final months of their time at St. Margaret\u2019s. \u201cMay they shine as models of hope, carrying the essence of St. Margaret\u2019s spirit in all their actions and interactions, illuminating paths not just for themselves, but for the world,\u201d Dr. Graham said. \u201cAmen.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

Much of his talk centered around helping children feel seen, using the phrase \u201cless transaction, more interaction\u201d and providing tools for parents to help navigate relationships with their children, and to help their children navigate relationships with peers and teachers. His talk was followed by a Q&A moderated by Patrick Bendzick, St. Margaret\u2019s assistant head of school for health and wellness. Later in the day, Mr. Harris shared his insight to the entire Upper School and Middle School, before speaking in smaller sessions to Middle School and Upper School student leaders which focused on deeper skill-building around relationships, dignity and belonging through discussions around case studies. Student leaders included the Middle School student council and service class, as well as Upper School Admission Ambassadors, ASB, Peer Counselors, Honor Committee, Tartan Tutors and TIDE. The PTF Parent Up Speaker Series is a parent-education initiative by the PTF in collaboration with school leaders. This year\u2019s series also included an inspiring talk by former USC football player Jake Olson in October.

St. Margaret\u2019s parents as well as Upper School and Middle School students were treated to an inspiring presentation by the first speaker in the 2024-2025 PTF Parent Up Speaker Series. Jake Olson visited St. Margaret\u2019s last week to share his inspiring story on how he overcame retinoblastoma to become the first totally blind Division I college football player. Mr. Olson shared his story of losing one eye in infancy to the rare cancer of the retina, followed by a childhood full of hospital stays amid several recurrences which eventually led to losing his other eye at the age of 12. Through the power of faith, the support of loved ones and the community, and his own perseverance, Mr. Olson moved forward and attained achievements nobody thought possible. Wanting to be around the game of football, Mr. Olson worked diligently with coaches at his high school in Orange County to learn how to become a long snapper on the football team despite being totally blind. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at the University of Southern California and walked on to the Trojan football team as a long snapper. He saw his first game action on Sept. 2, 2017, successfully snapping the ball during an extra-point attempt against Western Michigan to make college football history. \u201cI never wanted this to happen to me, but this is the hand I was dealt in life,\u201d Mr. Olson told the parent audience. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I have to forfeit my hopes and dreams.\u201d Mr. Olson\u2019s powerful message was mixed with humor and inspiration, expressing the importance of faith in his life and encouraging Tartans to not set limits and fight through adversity. After a morning talk and meet-and-greet with the parent community, Mr. Olson also met with Middle School and Upper School students, sharing one of his favorite quotes which resonated with many members of the St. Margaret\u2019s community: \u201cIf you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.\u201d The PTF Parent Up Speaker Series is an educational initiative generously funded by the PTF Grant Enrichment Program, bringing fascinating speakers with relevant topics to the St. Margaret\u2019s community.

Lower School\u2019s grade 5 students are getting their hands wet in a home water consumption project, a unique science class experiment led by science teacher David Beshk. The project is designed to help students understand the significance of water conservation, especially in a region like Southern California, where water scarcity is a growing challenge. Over the last few weeks, students were tracking their personal water usage at home. Armed with simple tools, they calculated usage from their showers, bathroom faucets, and kitchen sinks documenting the amount of water each activity consumes. The project aims to raise awareness about how individual behaviors contribute to overall water consumption. The home water consumption project is a long-term activity with many facets. The multi-layer project includes months of lessons, engineering assignments, and collaboration for students to gain the comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between the physical geography of California, the water cycle, and the engineering required to deliver Southern California the fresh water required to support millions of people. Students are provided an opportunity to reflect on their individual contributions to the environment and how their actions connect to larger ecological systems. Mr. Beshk remarks, \u201cMy hope is that by the end of the unit, students will have developed a deeper sense of their role within the water cycle and the greater global community through their use and discharge of waste water back into the Pacific Ocean.\u201d The unit touches on all elements of STEAM learning\u2014science, technology, engineering, art, and math\u2014and gives students the opportunity to see first-hand the impact of their daily habits. With Southern California's reliance on water from sources like the Sierra Nevadas and Lake Havasu, students are learning about the unique challenges of providing water to millions of residents in the region. By exploring their own water usage, they gain insight into how they can do their part to conserve water. Through this hands-on approach, students also learned how to reduce their water footprint. \u201cI hope through the gathering and analysis of personal data, each student can develop a personalized plan to be more efficient with their water usage while sharing what they\u2019ve learned with friends and family.\u201d said Mr. Beshk.

The Lower School grades 2-3 musical production delighted audiences with nine performances of The Aristocats in the McGregor Family Theater. This beloved Disney classic, previously staged by The Arts at St. Margaret\u2019s in 2017, returned with three casts and more than 80 students with a Middle School technical crew helping backstage and in the technical booth. Under the direction of Katie DeShan, Middle School theater teacher and director, with musical direction and choreography by Zach Hanna, K-5 music and Lower School musical director, the production was filled with heartwarming moments and fun for the audiences. The story follows the Aristocats, a group of pampered felines who are taken to the countryside outside of Paris by their scheming butler, Edgar. As they embark on their journey back home, they encounter an array of animals, including the Alley Cats led by Thomas O\u2019Malley, a mouse named Roquefort and geese named Abigail and Amelia Gabble. They also meet four investigative hounds with a leader named Napoleon. The production featured crowd-favorite musical numbers, including the jazzy Everybody Wants to Be a Cat and the charming Scales and Arpeggios. The production was meaningful in a different way for a few of the current cast members who had older siblings who participated in the 2017 production, making this a special family tradition. With adorable costumes, energetic choreography, and enthusiastic performances, The Aristocats proved to be a hit among students, families, and faculty. Ms. DeShan said, \u201cI am so proud of the cast members for sharing their gifts on stage and supporting each other. They really created a caring and fun community.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

St. Margaret\u2019s had a vibrant, engaging in-service day on Monday, as more than 100 professional community members from the Middle School and Upper School traveled to Julian to take part in an experiential-education professional development day. The in-service day was centered around Camp Stevens in Julian, the longtime location of the Upper School\u2019s annual grade 12 retreat. The US and MS faculty were able to take part in one of 10 different experiential-learning workshops which were designed to build community among teachers, position the professional community as engaged learners, and introduce the why and how of experiential learning as a teaching practice. Each workshop centered around the Experiential Learning Cycle developed by psychologist David Kolb, which is the basis of a continuous learning through experience. The cycle includes: Concrete Experience: Where the learners engages in a new experience. Reflective Observation of the Experience : Where the learner reflects on the experience in the light of their existing knowledge. Abstract Conceptualization: Where the reflection gives rise to a new idea or modifies an existing abstract concept. Active Experimentation : Where the newly created concept gives rise to new experimentation, and the learner applies their ideas to the world around them. Each of the in-service day activities were organized and experienced through the lens of Kolb\u2019s Experiential Learning Cycle. The professional community had the opportunity to explore geography and cartography, examine the historical and cultural evolution of Julian, explore the sociology of food, dive into the work of California mosaic artist James Hubbell, hike along the famed Pacific Crest Trail, investigate textile artistry, experience the ecosystem through birding, and examine species conservation at the California Wolf Center. Two other opportunities took place outside of Julian, exploring California\u2019s Mission System and examining the cultural rise and social dynamics around the rapidly growing sport of pickleball. The in-service day was both a community-building opportunity among the Tartan professional community as well as an opportunity to see experiential learning in action, as St. Margaret\u2019s school leaders continue to evolve the academic curriculum to integrate more experiential education. The in-service day was overseen by Director of Experiential Education Dr. Ryan Carey, Upper School Principal Amy Roberts and Middle School Principal Mike Allison, with curriculum developed by principals and directors of community life, and facilitated by faculty in both the Upper School and Middle School. Lower School St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School professional community had an division-specific in-service day with important training and grade-level planning. Kindergarten and grade 1 co-teachers took part in a Outdoor Classroom training workshop led by Lower School K-1 science teacher Chelsea Shoemate, while classroom teachers fine-tuned their assessment process. Grades 2-5 co-teachers took part in a workshop around social-emotional learning, while classroom teachers in grade 2 planned a weather and fire preparedness unit and grades 3-5 teacher debriefed on a previous Ron Clark Academy professional development centered around student culture. The morning workshops were followed by a Learning for Justice exercise, with the afternoon dedicated to grade-level planning. Early School Early School Director Dr. Cris Lozon and Assistant Director Dr. Sonia Yoshizawa led an engaging discussion with Early School faculty. The Early School spent time focusing on constructivism and play, diving into the science behind brain development and how young children learn. They also worked on productive questioning, and how early-childhood educators can use questions to stimulate curiosity and deeper thinking among young children.

The Johnson Wallis Visual Arts Center was buzzing with creativity and collaboration as grade 7 science students joined the Upper School students in Advanced Ceramics and Architecture for an exciting hands-on learning experience. The students took part in a \u201cform vs. function design challenge,\u201d where they built bird towers\u2014a structure that blends artistic design with practical functionality. The challenge kicked off with teams of grade 7 students working alongside their Upper School mentors, who guided them through the design and construction process while also showcasing artistic and architectural creativity. The teams of three to four grade 7 students explored the balance between form in artistic expression and function, the structural integrity needed to create a habitat suitable for birds. This challenge provided students with an exciting opportunity for hands-on learning, mentorship, and creative problem-solving, all while designing structures that balance beauty and purpose in the natural world. The primary goal of the Bird Towers challenge is for students to design a functional bird habitat that also showcases creative artistic elements. The teams are tasked with making choices to emphasize either form (the aesthetic beauty and artistry of the tower) or function (its durability and practicality as a bird-friendly shelter), while keeping both aspects in mind. Advanced Ceramics and Architecture students stepped into leadership roles, helping their younger peers navigate this exciting project. These mentors bring valuable experience, sharing architectural and ceramic techniques that allow the grade 7 students to experiment with structure and design.

St. Margaret's boys soccer program advanced to the CIF-SS Div. VI Final with a gutsy 1-0 win over hosts Pioneer High School. The Tartans look to capture their first CIF Championship since 2003. A tough midfield battle, Saturday's match saw both teams well prepared and tactically level. The Tartans and Titans pressed high, cutting off passing lanes and limiting scoring opportunities in the first half. A Pioneer goal was waved off after an offside call, leaving the teams tied at 0-0 at halftime. The second half remained relatively the same until the 60th minute saw the Titans press their opportunity against the Tartans' goal. Keeper Gio Voccola parried away a Titan one-on-one opportunity to keep the Tartans alive. The Tartans remained composed and defensively compact, looking to counter effectively. St. Margaret's found an opening in the 78th minute as Angel Cruz-Sanchez made a perfectly timed run behind the Titan defense and collected a well-placed through ball as he broke through. The Pioneer goalkeeper rushed off his line to thwart Cruz-Sanchez's run but was too late as Cruz-Sanchez slotted a pass to a waiting Lucas Monge, who tapped it in to send the Tartans to the finals. Monge was the hero for the second time in two games, as his goal in the semifinal match kept the Tartans ahead of Lawndale High. The Tartan will face Channel Islands High School in the Final on Tartan Field. Please stay tuned to the SMES Athletics website and social media accounts for date and time. Go Tartans!

St. Margaret\u2019s Upper School students in AP 3D Design, Advanced Study 3D Design and Advanced Clay Handbuilding are learning a new form of art in a series of hands-on session in Laguna Beach: bronze sculpting. The Upper School students immersed in the bronze casting workshop titled Artists Voice: Sense of Place providing the opportunity to learn and also discover more about personal expression through art. The workshop took place at the ArtLofts in Laguna Beach. This innovative program focused on the ancient technique of lost wax bronze casting, allowing students in Upper School\u2019s advanced courses to create detailed metal sculptures from their own wax models. Lost wax bronze casting is a meticulous process that begins with creating a wax model, with molten bronze poured into a mold created around the model. Louis Longi the founder of ArtLofts and a renowned artist who previously created art for Cirque du Soleil, led the workshop. He shared his story with Upper School students about his development as an artist and the difference his high school art teacher made in his life. The bronze workshop experience provides a unique opportunity for young artists. \u201cMost high schools don\u2019t have this opportunity and only some colleges do. So it's amazing that Louis is willing to do this with our students,\u201d said Jesse Standlea, visual arts teacher. Inspired by the surroundings where ArtLoft was located, some Upper School students were translating the natural beauty of Laguna Canyon into their artworks. The connection between nature and their creative processes is a significant aspect of the program, highlighting the intersection of environment and artistic expression. This unique artwork is also a chance for visual arts students to further diversify their portfolios, as some advanced study students incorporate their portfolios into their college applications if they look to continue studying visual arts in college.

The Tartan boys soccer program is CIF-SS Quarterfinal round bound after a 1-0 win over visiting Garden Grove Saturday night. St. Margaret's needed almost 80 minutes of play to solve a tenacious Argonaut defensive scheme. The Tartans prepared for a technically sound Garden Grove squad by attempting to negate their biggest threat, a shifty attacker.. Evan Causee was up to the challenge, neutralizing the threat and keeping St. Margaret's in control all afternoon. Possession in the midfield was the most significant battle for both teams, with many attempts to break defensive lines quickly neutralized. The Tartans remained compact and organized in the defensive end, carrying a slight momentum into halftime. The second half remained much of the same, with both teams limiting offensive chances on their goals. With a minute remaining in the game, the Tartans pressed forward with a well-driven cross into the Argonaut 18-yard box. Chaos ensued as a Garden Grove defender attempted to clear the ball while pulling a Tartans striker down, leaving a loose ball that was driven into the side of the goal past the Argonaut keeper by sophomore Zach Causee. After the Tartans' euphoria, the task remained to prevent a Garden Grove comeback. St. Margaret's gutted out the final 4 minutes of stoppage time as the Argonauts threw everything they had forward. The final whistle blew, sending the Tartans to the quarterfinals. \"The scoreboard tells the story here tonight,\" said head coach Pete Carey. \"Not just because of the goal scored, but the collective discipline, hard work, and commitment from every player on the field.\" The Tartans will face Lawndale High School on the road in the CIF-SS Div.

Segerstrom pressed high from the opening whistle, but the Tartans' resolve could not be broken. A scoreless tie sent both teams to the shelter of the locker room to regroup at halftime. Midway through the second half, the Tartans capitalized on a chaotic clearance attempt by the Jaguars in their own 18-yard box. Grayson Gallegos pounced on the loose ball, fought off a Segerstrom defender, and calmly slotted the eventual game-winner home. Segerstrom threw everything forward in search of an equalizer, but the Tartan defense stood firm, negating each attempt. Tartan goalkeeper Gio Voccola kept St. Margaret's organized, making key saves under immense pressure.

While learning about how ancient civilizations shaped much of West Africa\u2019s rich history, grade 7 students had an opportunity to relate these lessons to the modern world by a visit from guest speaker Reginald Lavender, a St. Margaret\u2019s parent and native of Nigeria. Mr. Lavender shared his personal experiences growing up in Nigeria, offering students a unique perspective on how the past still influences contemporary life. Through his stories, they learned about Nigeria\u2019s cultural vibrancy, from its bustling cities to its festivals and music, bringing history to life beyond the textbooks. Katie Harris, grade 7 world history teacher, expresses the value of learning about West African culture through real world experiences, She remarks, \u201cI hope that students will see that West African has a rich and culturally diverse history. While there are similarities, this is a vast area with many cultural and linguistic traditions.\u201d In addition to his stories, Mr. Lavender introduced the class to Nigerian cuisine, treating students to samples of the culture\u2019s food.

St. Margaret\u2019s is proud to announce the first endowed chair in school history, which will further the academic programming and support the extraordinary professional community in the science department. The Dr. Naveen and Mrs. Jennifer Yalamanchi Chair in Science will support and enhance St. Margaret\u2019s science department and the work of its department chair, longtime Upper School teacher Edmund Herlihy. The Endowment was created through a generous gift by the Yalamanchi family toward Tartans Thrive, St. Margaret\u2019s current capital campaign. Endowed chairs are common at the university level as a way to empower top academic minds and support research and programming. Like other endowments at St. Margaret\u2019s, a portion of the interest and capital gains from endowed chairs will be directed to support the science department and the department chair to further the academic programming for St. Margaret\u2019s students today and into the future. \u201cWe are so grateful for Dr. Naveen and Mrs. Jennifer Yalamanchi for this generous and visionary gift, which will support the expertise of our professional community and the learning of our students in science,\u201d St. Margaret\u2019s Head of School Dr. Jeneen Graham said. \u201cWe are excited to bring this strategically aligned philanthropy to St. Margaret\u2019s, as it will ensure our school will continue to thrive and our supporters will have a new way to uplift an aspect of St. Margaret\u2019s they are passionate about.\u201d As Ryan Korinke, the Chair of the Board of Trustees Investment Committee, recently shared at the State of the School address in January, the St. Margaret\u2019s endowment balance has surpassed the $25 million mark.

St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School gathered together for a historic celebration on Thursday, as the school community joyfully looked ahead to the exciting future of its campus during the St. Margaret\u2019s Commons Groundbreaking and Blessing. The ceremony was attended by the entire student body as well as professional community, parents and members of the Board of Trustees. \u201cThis groundbreaking signifies a commitment to the future of our school and our highest priority to provide students with an education that will shape the hearts and minds for lives of learning, leadership and service,\u201d Board of Trustees President Dana Sullivan said. The Groundbreaking and Blessing began with prayers and readings by the St. Margaret\u2019s chaplains, followed by remarks by Mrs. Sullivan and Head of School Dr. Jeneen Graham. The Chaplains then offered blessings for the site, before students from the Early School, Lower School, Middle School and Upper School took shovels to the dirt, ceremoniously marking the start of a new era. Joining the students were division principals, school administrators, PTF leaders and Trustees. Construction will now begin on the transformative 30,000-square-foot, two-story St. Margaret\u2019s Commons, which will become the heartbeat of the school campus and unite the community in a space dedicated to community, well-being, athletics and nutrition. The St. Margaret\u2019s Commons is on schedule to be completed in the fall of 2026, and will feature state-of-the-art fitness facilities, an expansive dining hall and kitchen with on-site chefs preparing meals throughout the day, and ample spaces for students and classes to gather and be together. The Groundbreaking and Blessing was a highly anticipated celebration after years of planning and collaboration, and school leaders acknowledged the many individuals and organizations whose hard work and generous support made the project a reality.

Lower School science teacher David Beshk connects months of learning into the lighthouse project, which is the formative project where grade 4 students study electricity, circuits, light waves, and lenses. Additional learnings include electrical concepts, series circuits, how conductors and insulators are used, open-versus-closed circuits and how a switch can govern the flow of electricity. Moreover, students applied the concepts of refracting and reflecting light using both mirrors and lenses. Mr. Beshk remarked, \u201cThere are many aspects of the lighthouse project that are fun, but seeing the grade 4 students \u2018light up\u2019 when they solder their circuits and the LED begins to shine is the best. They are so proud of the fact that they independently built a functional electrical circuit, they can\u2019t contain the excitement.\u201d The lighthouses also demonstrate how light is used to communicate. These glowing towers are valuable to navigation and identifying dangerous objects in waterways. However, the distinctive patterns, day marks, on lighthouses also communicate information. These multi-colored stripes and patterns are part of the lighthouses each student builds and designs. In addition to learning about how daymarks were used as navigational aids to sailors, students also learned about the lifestyles and challenges faced by lighthouse keepers. Mr. Beshk points out that the lighthouses spark students beyond the classroom. \u201cThe sense of joy, pride and accomplishment from the students resonates the most. Students will spend weeks planning, researching, designing and building projects like this, and that\u2019s no small task. In the end, they\u2019ve constructed such a deep, visceral connection with the concepts, and that\u2019s my goal as an educator, to create constructivist opportunities for learning.\u201d Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

The All-School Service Learning Project is an annual tradition at St. Margaret\u2019s, a chance for all divisions to unite and meet the authentic needs of a partner organization, provide a cross-divisional opportunity for student learning, and rally the school community around a common purpose. The project launched at the St. Margaret\u2019s Day All-School service in November, and will conclude at the All-School Spring Service in March. Special Camp has been hosted at St. Margaret's since 1992. Special Camp brings youth with disabilities and peer counselors together for week-long summer day camps and activities throughout the year. Special Camp provides a safe space for having fun and building genuine, life-long friendships. Counselors are given the chance to work in a positive, nurturing environment that fosters an educational atmosphere of opportunities to explore the intricacies and the needs of this community with a focus on learning abilities, communication skills, emotional well-being, and social development. The organization supports more than 150 campers and 150 counselors annually. As part of the learning, St. Margaret\u2019s Lower School students were paired with Upper School students this week, dividing into small groups and rotating through the five Special Camp activity centers. Students had the opportunity to see and participate in the centers, similar to Special Camp students\u2019 experience during the summer program. These activity centers include arts and crafts, entertainment, games and reading, sensory integration and sports. In addition, Middle School students and Early School students have connected several times, reading children\u2019s books about inclusivity with a focus on the disabled community. Looking ahead, they will have the opportunity to experience the activity centers first-hand on Friday, January 24. The goal of the activity center visits is for students to spend time together, learn more about the Special Camp program, and support the donation drive to supply the Special Camp activity centers. The activity centers are utilized during Special Camp programming to provide spaces for campers to have fun, hang out, and decompress, while meeting their range of needs. St. Margaret\u2019s All-School Service Learning Project is funded by the William N. Moseley Venture to Serve, an endowment fund created in 2023 by the Board of Trustees to fund the All-School Service Learning Project as well as grants for students, alumni and professional community members interested in serving the community.

St. Margaret's boys soccer beat Northwood 2-1 Friday to improve to 3-2 in league play. Although the Tartans had a slow start in the first half, St. Margaret's repulsed Northwood's many scoring chances with solid defensive play. Led by goalkeeper Mason Allison, the Tartans regrouped and were able to counter the Timberwolf attack. St. Margaret's had a breakthrough late in the first half, with Lucas Monge burying a loose ball sent in off a set-piece play to make it 1-nil St. Margaret's. Northwood quickly responded with an Equalizer to send it to 1-1 at the half. The Tartans came out strong in the second half with a change in tactics leading to a balanced back-and-forth battle. Northwood continued to produce quality chances, but the stellar goaltending play of Gio Voccola, who turned away three blistering Timberwolf shots, kept the Tartans in the game. High-intensity play generated by Angel Cruz-Sanchez eventually led to the game-winner, with Monge finding the net to put St. Margaret's ahead. The Tartans look to keep the momentum going with a crucial league tie against University at home on Tuesday, Jan. 14, at 7:00 p.m. Back St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School 31641 La Novia Avenue San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 (949) 661-0108 Translation? \u00bfTraducci\u00f3n? \u7ffb\u8bd1?: An Independent Preschool Through Grade 12 College-Preparatory Day School in Orange County California Non-Discrimination Policy St. Margaret's Episcopal School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national and ethnic origin in the administration of its educational, admission, financial aid, hiring and athletic policies or in other school-administered programs.

With stations set up at Chalmers Field, Middle School students in the grade 6 Health and Well-Being course invited Lower School students to engage in fun activities and learn more about a variety of topics during a health and wellness fair before the break. The fair was a chance for grade 6 students to share their learning and encourage good health and wellness to the younger Tartans. Grade 3 students came together to explore all of the offerings during the 30-minute fair. The health and wellness fair project provided grade 6 and grade 3 students an opportunity to explore various aspects of personal, mental, spiritual, and digital health. Through hands-on activities and interactive booths, students engaged in practical experiences that reinforced the concepts learned in the classroom. There was a station where students could try yoga poses. Another gave an introduction to first aid and CPR, how to pack an emergency kit, identifying AI images and stories, online safety, practicing mindfulness, and practicing gratitude. All of the stations were the culmination of a semester-concluding project for students in the grade 6 health and wellness class. The lesson also extended into St. Margaret\u2019s mission of educating the hearts and minds of students. Leslie Pacheco-Manning, Personal Fitness & Wellness teacher, explained, \u201cOne of the most significant learning impacts of the fair for grade 6 students was developing leadership and teaching skills. By preparing lessons and activities for grade 3 students, they strengthen their ability to communicate effectively, simplify complex ideas, and adapt their explanations to meet the needs of younger students.\u201d The Health and Well-Being course is divided into three rotations: personal health led by Ms. Pacheco-Manning, Spiritual Health with Father Earl Gibson, and Digital Health presented by Library teacher Jillian Kartchner. Grade 6 students rotate through the three sections and engage in these different aspects of health and wellness. \u201cWalking around and observing the interactions between the MS and LS students is my favorite part of this project. The grade 6 students show maturity and kindness as they mentor the grade 3 students and answer their questions about the topics they are presenting,\u201d said Ms. Pacheco-Manning.

School leaders have been hard at work this year constructing a new Strategic Plan for St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. The Strategic Plan will be finalized this summer. It will mark the end of a three-prong process that has involved the entire school community over the past year. Here\u2019s a closer look: Feedback and Data St. Margaret\u2019s has solicited feedback from parents, students and alumni through anonymous surveys this school year, in addition to feedback from the local community, idea-generating exercises at PTF General Membership Meetings and PTF Executive Board Meetings, and the completion of a market research report to better understand St. Margaret\u2019s positioning in the educational landscape. This feedback was influential in identifying strategic directions that the school community is eager to pursue, which was aggregated and presented to St. Margaret\u2019s Strategic Plan steering committee, a 21-member team made up of Trustees, school leaders, faculty, staff, students and parents. Engagement The pillars of St. Margaret\u2019s new Strategic Plan were further developed through a number of engagement opportunities. A professional community in-service day in January was dedicated to generate ideas and clarify focus areas. The Board of Trustees has dived into strategic-plan work at an October retreat and during several meetings, including multiple Board long-range planning committee meetings. Design In designing a Strategic Plan to present to the Board of Trustees, the 34-member design team divided into eight groups, where they had several meetings to talk through ideas and feedback and to collectively craft initiative proposals for consideration. These proposals were aggregated and discussed at a final steering committee meeting in early May, before a final draft was put together and presented to the Board of Trustees. Next Steps The Board of Trustees met in May to review the Strategic Plan draft and offer feedback. The plan will undergo a series of revisions before it is finalized and adopted by the Board of Trustees this summer. The new Strategic Plan will be shared with the St. Margaret\u2019s school community soon after.

St. Margaret\u2019s is making significant progress in the development of a new Strategic Plan to shape the future direction of the school. Over the course of this school year, the Strategic Plan Steering Committee\u2014made up of Trustees, professional community members, alumni and Upper School students\u2014has been hard at work establishing initial strategic initiatives, emerging goals and proposed strategies based on community feedback, market research and more. The Steering Committee is now divided into eight groups, each tasked with researching and developing action plans in their assigned goals. The teams are responsible for further refining and detailing the implementation of strategic goals, including timelines and metrics for success. These preliminary plans will be submitted in April and refined by the Steering Committee before being presented to the Board of Trustees later this spring. As part of the feedback process, St. Margaret\u2019s Head of School Dr. Jeneen Graham presented at the most recent PTF General Membership Meeting. There, she shared an update on the Strategic Plan timeline before leading parents in attendance in an exercise to solicit further feedback. Parents were given six strategic ideas that had consistently emerged during the process and were tasked with ranking them in order of importance from their perspective. Parents and other members of the school community had the chance to take part in a strategic planning survey earlier in the process to identify priorities. The Strategic Plan will be finalized this summer, at which point it will be shared with the St. Margaret\u2019s community.

St. Margaret's kicked off its All-School Service Learning Project last month during the St. Margaret\u2019s Day celebration. This year\u2019s partnership is with Special Camp, an organization hosted by St. Margaret\u2019s which brings youth with disabilities together with counselors for week-long day camps in the summer and activities throughout the school year. The All-School Service Learning Project will continue into the spring, with a service element involving the entire school community as well activities planned across all four divisions with the goal of deepening the commitment to inclusion, leadership, and community engagement. These activities started last week, as Special Camp campers, counselors and Upper School student volunteers visited the Lower School to engage in activities and education centered around the disabled community. A particularly memorable part of each session was Musical Cones, an adaptive version of the classic game of musical chairs. By swapping out chairs for cones and making other slight adjustments, Special Camp's team demonstrated how small changes to traditional games can make them accessible to everyone regardless of ability. \u201cThese activities fostered empathy and understanding while promoting the value of inclusive play,\u201d Special Camp Director Lindsay Eres said. Throughout the sessions, Special Camp campers offered valuable perspectives. A special moment highlighted one of the campers teaching the Lower School students how to say Merry Christmas in American Sign Language (ASL). In addition, Upper School students served an essential role supporting Special Camp Staff modeling leadership and inclusion. The Lower School students also had the chance to share some of their favorite games: tag, Sorry!, and hide-and-seek. Mrs. Eres and Associate Director Katie Schwartz led the Lower School students in brainstorming ideas to adapt these games to demonstrate how to make playtime more accessible. In addition to the educational touchpoints, the All-School Service Learning Project is also an opportunity to partner with and support the local community. St. Margaret\u2019s will lead donation drives and other service opportunities in the months ahead to meet authentic needs within Special Camp and its community.

St. Margaret\u2019s welcomed educators, academic leaders and curriculum specialists for the 2nd annual St. Margaret\u2019s Summer Institute, an engaging professional development experience grounded in constructivist theory, place-based learning and transdisciplinary approaches. Over two days, attendees immersed in experiential education and the foundations for bringing this approach to learning into the classroom. The first day included a deep-dive into experiential education, featuring two engaging activities that took place at nearby Doheny State Beach. The workshops included: Oceans of Wonder: Perception, Place, and the Natural World - An immersive workshop that explored the sometimes complementary and sometimes contradictory ways humans come to know the natural world\u2014by observation and engagement, inquiry and imagination, through labor and leisure, science and study. Waves of Belonging: Surfing, Subjectivity, and Stories - The experiential workshop explored the intersection of identity and collective memory through the lens of Southern California surf culture. Participants examined how the ocean\u2014and the stories told around it\u2014shapes who we are, who we imagine ourselves to be, and what we choose to forget. Participants also explore how innovation, entrepreneurship, and consumerism have driven surf culture, from aerospace-influenced board design to the rise of a billion-dollar industry built on the image of freedom and rebellion. While set in the beautiful coastal environment of Southern California, the learning was designed to transcend location, allowing attendees to take powerful principles back to their classrooms no matter where they teach. The second day featured a workshop led by Dr. Jackie Grennon-Brooks, Professor Emerita at Hofstra University and co-founder of the Long Island Explorium in Port Jefferson, N.Y. Dr. Grennon Brooks led a workshop exploring sand and water play, exploring natural materials and tackling challenges that mirror the dynamic learning environments of each student. Thank you to everyone who took part in this extraordinary weekend of professional development!

School leaders have been hard at work this year constructing a new Strategic Plan for St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School. The Strategic Plan will be finalized this summer. It will mark the end of a three-prong process that has involved the entire school community over the past year. Here\u2019s a closer look: Feedback and Data St. Margaret\u2019s has solicited feedback from parents, students and alumni through anonymous surveys this school year, in addition to feedback from the local community, idea-generating exercises at PTF General Membership Meetings and PTF Executive Board Meetings, and the completion of a market research report to better understand St. Margaret\u2019s positioning in the educational landscape. This feedback was influential in identifying strategic directions that the school community is eager to pursue, which was aggregated and presented to St. Margaret\u2019s Strategic Plan steering committee, a 21-member team made up of Trustees, school leaders, faculty, staff, students and parents. Engagement The pillars of St. Margaret\u2019s new Strategic Plan were further developed through a number of engagement opportunities. A professional community in-service day in January was dedicated to generate ideas and clarify focus areas. The Board of Trustees has dived into strategic-plan work at an October retreat and during several meetings, including multiple Board long-range planning committee meetings. Design In designing a Strategic Plan to present to the Board of Trustees, the 34-member design team divided into eight groups, where they had several meetings to talk through ideas and feedback and to collectively craft initiative proposals for consideration. These proposals were aggregated and discussed at a final steering committee meeting in early May, before a final draft was put together and presented to the Board of Trustees. Next Steps The Board of Trustees met in May to review the Strategic Plan draft and offer feedback. The plan will undergo a series of revisions before it is finalized and adopted by the Board of Trustees this summer. The new Strategic Plan will be shared with the St. Margaret\u2019s school community soon after.

Progress continues on the construction of the St. Margaret\u2019s Commons, the 30,000-square-foot building that will be the heart of the campus and serve all Tartans in their nutrition, fitness and well-being. The Commons is schedule to open in the fall of 2026. Here are a few updates on the project: Construction Update Crews have been hard at work setting the foundation for the building. This week, the concrete footings were poured, which involved 48 cement trucks, two boom pumps and an on-site inspector testing and analyzing the concrete mix. The work will continue through the summer, with one aspect of the Commons scheduled to be completed in time for the 2025-2026 school year. The Fieldside Courtyard, an outdoor patio area between the new building and Chalmers Field, will be a spot for students to eat lunch, socialize and catch up on school work starting next school year. Site Tours Del Amo Construction has led several tours of the site with Early School and Lower School students recently, providing the students with personal protective equipment including a hard hat and safety vest, along with a personal tour led by the general contractor team who answered a lot of great student questions about the project. The site visits were a PTF Online Auction item generously donated by Del Amo. School Visits In preparation for the Commons and its dining services, several St. Margaret\u2019s school leaders recently visited Francis Parker School in San Diego to observe the logistics of its food service operations. The St. Margaret\u2019s Commons will include an on-site kitchen with chefs preparing fresh meals daily. It will provide lunch for every division of the school, daily snack for Lower School, and a grab-and-go market for Middle and Upper School.
